%description
Yacas is an easy to use, general purpose Computer Algebra System, a
program for symbolic manipulation of mathematical expressions. It uses
its own programming language designed for symbolic as well as
arbitrary-precision numerical computations. The system has a library
of scripts that implement many of the symbolic algebra operations; new
algorithms can be easily added to the library. Yacas comes with
extensive documentation (hundreds of pages) covering the scripting
language, the functionality that is already implemented in the system,
and the algorithms we used.
