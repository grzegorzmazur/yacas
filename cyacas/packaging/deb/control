Description: Easy to use, general purpose Computer Algebra System
 Yacas is an easy to use, general purpose Computer Algebra System, a
 program for symbolic manipulation of mathematical expressions. It
 uses its own programming language designed for symbolic as well as
 arbitrary-precision numerical computations. The system has a library
 of scripts that implement many of the symbolic algebra operations;
 new algorithms can be easily added to the library. Yacas comes with
 extensive documentation covering the scripting language, the
 functionality that is already implemented in the system, and the
 algorithms we used.
