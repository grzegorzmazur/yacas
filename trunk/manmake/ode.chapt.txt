			Differential Equations

*INTRO In this chapter, some facilities for solving differential
equations are described. Currently only simple equations without
auxilliary conditions are supported.

*CMD OdeSolve --- General ODE solver
*STD
*CALL
	OdeSolve(expr1==expr2)
*PARMS

{expr1,expr2} -- expressions containing function to solve for

*DESC

This function currently can solve second order homogeneous linear real constant
coefficient equations. The solution is returned with unique constants
generated by {UniqueConstant}. The roots of the auxilliary equation are 
used as the arguments of exponentials. If the roots are complex conjugate
pairs, then the solution returned is in the form of exponentials, sines
and cosines.

First and second derivatives are entered as {y',y''}. Higher order derivatives
may be entered as {y(n)}, where {n} is any integer. 


*E.G.

	In> OdeSolve( y'' + y == 0 )
	Out> C42*Sin(x)+C43*Cos(x);
	In> OdeSolve( 2*y'' + 3*y' + 5*y == 0 )
	Out> Exp(((-3)*x)/4)*(C78*Sin(Sqrt(31/16)*x)+C79*Cos(Sqrt(31/16)*x));
	In> OdeSolve( y'' - 4*y == 0 )
	Out> C132*Exp((-2)*x)+C136*Exp(2*x);
	In> OdeSolve( y'' +2*y' + y == 0 )
	Out> (C183+C184*x)*Exp(-x);
