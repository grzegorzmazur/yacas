			Running Yacas

		Interactive session commands

*INTRO
This section describes the special commands for the Yacas interactive sessions (for example, to restart or to exit the interpreter).
These commands are not functions but special directives
that only apply while running Yacas interactively.
They should not be used in scripts.


*CMD ?, ?? --- get online help
*CORE
*CALL
	?function
	??
*PARMS

{function} -- name of function or keyword to request help on

*DESC

The directive {?} is used to request online help while running an interactive session. A name of a function or a help keyword can be specified.
The corresponding reference manual section will be shown.
(There is a special glossary section that contains keywords and explains some of the Yacas terminology.)

Function names should be given without quotes.
Note that function names are case-sensitive in Yacas but the {?} facility will also respond to all lowercase names.

The directive {??} displays the index to all documentation.

Documentation is displayed in a Web browser of your choice. The default choice is {lynx}.
An alternative browser can be set using the {SetHelpBrowser} function.

*E.G.

Get help on a function:
	In> ?Random
The function name can be given in all lowercase:
	In> ?makefunctionplugin

Get help on a keyword:
	In> ?arity

Browse all documentation:
	In> ??

*SEE Help, SetHelpBrowser

*CMD quit, restart, Ctrl-C --- basic session control
*CORE
*CALL
	quit
	restart

*DESC

Type {quit} or {restart} at the Yacas prompt to exit or to restart the interpreter.

The directives {quit} and {restart} are <i>not</i> reserved words or variable names.
They take effect only when typed as first characters at a prompt.

Pressing {Ctrl-C} will stop the currently running calculation.
If there is no currently running calculation, {Ctrl-C} will quit the interpreter.

When the interpreter quits, it saves the command history
(so quitting by {Ctrl-C} does not mean a "crash").

*E.G.

To be effective, the directive must be typed immediately after the prompt:
	In> quit
	Quitting...
We can use variables named {quit}:
	In> 1+quit
	Out> quit+1;
There is no effect if we type some spaces first: 
	In>       restart
	Out> restart;

			Startup configuration

*INTRO
Yacas allows you to configure a few things at startup. The file
{~/.yacasrc} is written in the Yacas language and
will be executed when Yacas is run. The
following functions can be useful in the {~/.yacasrc} file.

*CMD DefaultDirectory --- add directory to path for Yacas scripts
*CORE
*CALL
	DefaultDirectory(path)

*PARMS

{path} -- a string containing a full path where yacas script files reside

*DESC

When loading files, yacas is also allowed to
look in the folder "path". {path} will be prepended
to the file name before trying to load the file.
This means that "path" should end with a forward slash (under Unix-like
operating systems).

Yacas first tries to load a file from the current
directory, and otherwise it tries to load from
directories defined with this function, in the
order they are defined. Note there will be at least one directory
specified at start-up time, defined during compilation. This
is the directory Yacas searches for the initialization scripts
and standard scripts.

*E.G.

	In> DefaultDirectory("/home/user/myscripts/");
	Out> True;

*SEE Load, Use, DefLoad, FindFile

*CMD PrettyPrinter --- set routine to use as pretty-printer

*STD

*CALL
	PrettyPrinter(printer)
	PrettyPrinter()
	GetPrettyPrinter()

*PARMS

{printer} -- a string containing the name of a function that can "pretty-print" an expression.


*DESC

This function sets up the function printer to print out the results on
the command line. This can be reset to the internal printer with {PrettyPrinter()} (when no argument is given, the system returns to the default).

Currently implemented prettyprinters are: {PrettyForm}, {TeXForm}, {Print}, {OMForm}, {CForm} and {DefaultPrint}.

{GetPrettyPrinter()} returns the current pretty printer, or it returns
an empty string if the default pretty printer is used.

*E.G.

	In> Taylor(x,0,5)Sin(x)
	Out> x-x^3/6+x^5/120;
	In> PrettyPrinter("PrettyForm");
	
	True
	
	In> Taylor(x,0,5)Sin(x)
	
	     3    5
	    x    x
	x - -- + ---
	    6    120
	
	In> PrettyPrinter();
	Out> True;
	In> Taylor(x,0,5)Sin(x)
	Out> x-x^3/6+x^5/120;

*SEE PrettyForm, Write, TeXForm, CForm, OMForm

*CMD MaxEvalDepth --- set depth of recursion stack
*CORE
*CALL
	MaxEvalDepth(n)
*PARMS
{n} -- integer
*DESC
Sets the maximum depth of recursive function call. An error message is printed when too many recursive calls are executed, and this function can be used to increase or decrease the limit as necessary.



*CMD Help --- get documentation for some command
*STD
*CALL
	Help()
	Help(function)

*PARMS

{function} -- a string containing the name of a function to show help for

*DESC

When help is requested by the user, by typing {?}function or {??}, the functions {Help()} (for {??}) and {Help(}function{)} (for {?}function) are called.  By default, {lynx} is used as a
browser (another recommended text-only browser is {links}). The help resides in the subdirectory {documentation/} under the directory the math scripts
were installed in. So the help files can be found using {FindFile}.

The function {Help} is auxiliary and should not be used to actually get online help.

*E.G.

To use netscape for browsing help, enter the following commands:

	Help(_f) <-- SystemCall("netscape " :
	  FindFile("documentation/ref.html"):"#":f);
	Help() := SystemCall("netscape " :
	  FindFile("documentation/books.html"));

*SEE SystemCall, FindFile, ?

*CMD HistorySize --- set size of history file
*CORE
*CALL
	HistorySize(n)

*PARMS

{n} -- number of lines to store in history file

*DESC

When exiting, yacas saves the command line history to a
file {~/.yacas_history}. By default it will only
save the last 50 lines, to save space on the hard disk. This can be
overridden with this function. Passing -1 tells the system to save <i>all</i>
lines.

*E.G.

	In> HistorySize(200)
	Out> True;
	In> quit

*SEE quit
