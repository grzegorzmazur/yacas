			Complex numbers

*INTRO Yacas understands the concept of a complex number,
and has a few functions that allow manipulation of complex
numbers.

*CMD Complex --- construct a complex number
*STD
*CALL
	Complex(r, c)

*PARMS

{r} -- real part

{c} -- imaginary part

*DESC

This function represents the complex number "r + I*c", where "I"
is the imaginary unit. It is the standard representation used in Yacas
to represent complex numbers. Both "r" and "c" are supposed to be
real.

Note that, at the moment, many functions in Yacas assume that all
numbers are real unless it is obvious that it is a complex
number. Hence {Im(Sqrt(x))} evaluates to {0} which is only true for nonnegative "x".

*E.G.

	In> I
	Out> Complex(0,1);
	In> 3+4*I
	Out> Complex(3,4);
	In> Complex(-2,0)
	Out> -2;

*SEE Re, Im, I, Abs, Arg

*CMD Re --- real part of a complex number
*STD
*CALL
	Re(x)

*PARMS

{x} -- argument to the function

*DESC

This function returns the real part of the complex number "x".

*E.G.

	In> Re(5)
	Out> 5;
	In> Re(I)
	Out> 0;
	In> Re(Complex(3,4))
	Out> 3;

*SEE Complex, Im

*CMD Im --- imaginary part of a complex number
*STD
*CALL
	Im(x)

*PARMS

{x} -- argument to the function

*DESC

This function returns the imaginary part of the complex number "x".

*E.G.

	In> Im(5)
	Out> 0;
	In> Im(I)
	Out> 1;
	In> Im(Complex(3,4))
	Out> 4;

*SEE Complex, Re

*CMD I --- imaginary unit
*STD
*CALL
	I

*DESC

This symbol represents the imaginary unit, which equals the square
root of -1. It evaluates to {Complex(0,1)}.

*E.G.

	In> I
	Out> Complex(0,1);
	In> I = Sqrt(-1)
	Out> True;

*SEE Complex

*CMD Conjugate --- complex conjugate
*STD
*CALL
	Conjugate(x)

*PARMS

{x} -- argument to the function

*DESC

This function returns the complex conjugate of "x". The complex
conjugate of $a + I*b$ is $a - I*b$. This function assumes that all
unbound variables are real.

*E.G.

	In> Conjugate(2)
	Out> 2;
	In> Conjugate(Complex(a,b))
	Out> Complex(a,-b);

*SEE Complex, Re, Im

*CMD Arg --- argument of a complex number
*STD
*CALL
	Arg(x)

*PARMS

{x} -- argument to the function

*DESC

This function returns the argument of "x". The argument is the angle
with the positive real axis in the Argand diagram, or the angle
"phi" in the polar representation $r * Exp(I*phi)$ of "x". The
result is in the range ($-Pi$, $Pi$], that is, excluding $-Pi$ but including $Pi$. The
argument of 0 is {Undefined}.

*E.G.

	In> Arg(2)
	Out> 0;
	In> Arg(-1)
	Out> Pi;
	In> Arg(1+I)
	Out> Pi/4;

*SEE Abs, Sign
