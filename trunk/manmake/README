This directory contains all sources and scripts required to build the Yacas documentation.

It also has some additional experimental scripts that may be useful in the future.

txt2yacasdoc.pl: a Perl script to convert plaintext documentation to Yacas
language. (See the essays book or YacasDocs.chapt.txt for documentation on the plaintext format.)

book2txt.sh: a shell/perl/Yacas script to convert Yacas-language documentation
back to plain text (does not work on all docs and is not used any more)

book2TeX.sh: a shell/perl/Yacas script to convert Yacas-language documentation
to TeX

book2ys.sh: a shell/Yacas script to extract Yacas source code from examples in
Yacas-language documentation. ("Literate Programming")

book2xml.sh: a shell/Yacas script to convert Yacas-language documentation to XML. (experimental, not yet used)

api2txt.pl: a perl script to convert src/yacasapi.cpp into plain text
documentation (the list of kernel functions to be included into the reference
manual). This script depends on a particular syntax of the src/yacasapi.cpp
file.

ys2book.pl: a perl script to extract comments from Yacas source code and make a
separate file out of them. ("Literate Programming")

ytxt2tex: a standalone shell script to convert plaintext documentation to TeX.
(Requires book2TeX.* and txt2yacasdoc.pl). This script is not used to build documentation but is intended for other texts, as a simple TeX preprocessor.
