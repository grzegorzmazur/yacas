manmake: a tool that allows for an easier syntax for entering documentation
etcetera.

You can enter special sections with \section{text} where
you get to name your own section, and the text is some text.

This then gets converted to ManP(section,text) with text
enclosed in quotes. All text outside such special sections
are part of the section named 'text'.

		Tools for the new documentation format

txt2yacasdoc.pl: a Perl script to convert plaintext documentation to Yacas
language. (See the essays book for documentation on the plaintext format.)

book2txt.sh: a shell/perl/Yacas script to convert Yacas-language documentation
back to plain text (does not work on all docs and is not used any more)

book2TeX.sh: a shell/perl/Yacas script to convert Yacas-language documentation
to TeX (does not work on all docs)

book2ys.sh: a shell/Yacas script to extract Yacas source code from examples in
Yacas-language documentation. ("Literate programming")

book2xml.sh: a shell/Yacas script to convert Yacas-language documentation to XML.

api2txt.pl: a perl script to convert src/yacasapi.cpp into plain text
documentation (the list of kernel functions to be included into the reference
