This directory contains all sources and scripts required to build the Yacas documentation.
There are also some additional experimental scripts that may be useful in the future.

*.book.txt, *.chapt.txt - plaintext source files for documentation.
- See the essays book or YacasDocs.chapt.txt for information on the plaintext format.

txt2yacasdoc.pl: a Perl script to convert plaintext documentation to Yacas
language. - Required to compile documentation.

book2txt.sh: a shell/perl/Yacas script to convert Yacas-language documentation
back to plain text (does not cleanly work on all docs and is not used any more)

book2TeX.sh: a shell/perl/Yacas script to convert Yacas-language documentation
to TeX. - Required to produce PS/PDF documentation.

book2ys.sh: a shell/Yacas script to extract Yacas source code from examples in
Yacas-language documentation. ("Literate Programming") - Produces the Wester benchmark test out of the documentation chapter.

book2xml.sh: a shell/Yacas script to convert Yacas-language documentation to XML. - Experimental, not yet used.

ys2book.pl: a perl script to extract comments from Yacas source code and make a
separate file out of them. ("Literate Programming") - Experimental, not yet used.

ytxt2tex: a standalone shell script to convert plaintext documentation to TeX.
(Requires book2TeX.* and txt2yacasdoc.pl). This script is not used to build documentation but is intended for other texts, as a simple TeX preprocessor. It is installed together with Yacas.

txt2example.pl: a perl script to extract examples out of the "*E.G." sections  of the reference manual and create a special test file. (Only commands appearing after "In>" and "Out>" prompts are taken.) - Produces the test suite for the reference manual (it takes very long to run but useful to check the reference manual against the current state of Yacas).
