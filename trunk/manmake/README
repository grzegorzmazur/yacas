manmake: a tool that allows for an easier syntax for entering documentation
etcetera.

You can enter special sections with \section{text} where
you get to name your own section, and the text is some text.

This then gets converted to ManP(section,text) with text
enclosed in quotes. All text outside such special sections
are part of the section named 'text'.
