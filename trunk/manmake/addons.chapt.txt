			Platform-dependent packages

*INTRO Certain facilities have been developed for use on Unix-like platforms,
which is currently the main development target for Yacas. Other facilities have limited support on the Windows platform as well. These functions are described in this chapter.


*CMD Version --- show version of Yacas
*CORE
*CALL
	Version()

*DESC

The function {Version()} returns a string representing the version of the currently running Yacas interpreter.

*E.G. notest

	In> Version()
	Out> "1.0.48rev3";
	In> LessThan(Version(), "1.0.47")
	Out> False;
	In> GreaterThan(Version(), "1.0.47")
	Out> True;

The last two calls show that the {LessThan} and {GreaterThan}
functions can be used for comparing version numbers. This 
method is only guaranteed, however, if the version is always expressed
in the form {d.d.dd} as above.

*REM
Note that on the Windows platforms the output may be different:
In> Version()
Out> "Windows-latest";

*SEE LessThan, GreaterThan
