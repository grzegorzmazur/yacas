DESCRIPTION
</b><br>
<P>
This function builds a set of character tables which can be passed to
<b>pcre_compile()</b> to override PCRE's internal, built-in tables (which were
made by <b>pcre_maketables()</b> when PCRE was compiled). You might want to do
this if you are using a non-standard locale. The function yields a pointer to
the tables.

<P>
There is a complete description of the PCRE API in the
<a href="pcreapi.html"><b>pcreapi</b></a>
page.
