This directory contains Emacs lisp files to aid in interacting with 
Yacas from within Emacs.
It contains the files
  yacas.el   
  yacas-names.el
  yacas-functions.el
  yacas-notebook.el
  yacas-notebook.sty
  yacas-doc.el

yacas.el provides a mode for writing Yacas code, as well as a 
  mode for interacting with Yacas inside an Emacs buffer.
  It requires yacas-names.el and yacas-functions.el

yacas-notebook.el provides a notebook interface for Yacas from
  within Emacs.  It requires yacas.el (and so yacas-names.el 
  and yacas-functions.el) and yacas-notebook.sty

yacas-doc.el provides a mode for writing Yacas documentation
  in Emacs.

A quick introduction to these modes is provided at the beginning of
each file.
