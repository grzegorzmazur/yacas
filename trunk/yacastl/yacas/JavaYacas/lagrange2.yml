[title:Lagrange interpolation method 2]

[link:Show:f(x);]the polynomial that results from the Lagrange interpolation method.

 

Check that it evaluates to 8 for [link:x=-4:f(-4);], -3 for [link:x=2:f(2);]and 10 for[link:x=3:f(3);]. The polynomial further interpolates values in between the points it has to go through.
