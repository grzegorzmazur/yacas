Experimental stage of the Yacas compiler

Usage:
- ./build.sh will generate a file libplugin.so from the Yacas script
  file "testscript".
- The plugin dll can be loaded with DllLoad("./libplugin.so"); when in
  Yacas.

You can hand-tune the c++ code generated, which is in plugin.cc,
and then just recompile that file by typing "make".
