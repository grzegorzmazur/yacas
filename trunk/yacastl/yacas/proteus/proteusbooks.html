The Yacas Book of Algorithms
</A>
   This book is a detailed description of the algorithms used in the 
Yacas system for exact symbolic and arbitrary-precision numerical 
computations. Very few of these algorithms are new, and most are 
well-known. The goal of this book is to become a compendium of all
relevant issues of design and implementation of these algorithms.

(IN PROGRESS) Lisp as an Implementation Language for Computer Algebra Systems
</A>
Lisp is a very simple language, one suited for doing computer algebra. 
Almost all CAS systems today owe a lot to the ideas that came from Lisp. 
This is a book on the Lisp language, and its connection to Yacas. Yacas 
is built on top of a Lisp dialect.
