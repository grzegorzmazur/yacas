    <h1>Fun with derivatives part 1: defining the concept of a derivative in <i>Yacas</i></h1>
    <p>
      <i>Yacas</i> offers the possibility of defining transformation rules. Taking a derivative of a function is 
      a process that can be easily explained through such transformation rules (although not a necessary constraint,
      one can define the same operation easily in other languages also). You need surprisingly few lines of code
      to actually define the operation of taking a derivative. We will develop the code that can be used in <i>Yacas</i>
      in this article.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Yacas</i> of course already has similar functionality. One can take a derivative through the D function.
      But it is still a good example for showing how to use transformation rules in <i>Yacas</i>, as very few lines
      of code are needed and most people readily know the transformation rules by heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will define the function dd, which will take two arguments. The first is the variable, the second the function 
      to take the derivative off (with respect to the variable given as first argument).
    </p>
    <p>
      First we can tell the system that taking the derivative of a variable with respect to itself (eg. taking the derivative of
      x with respect to x) is one:
<pre>
dd(_x,_x) &lt;-- 1;
</pre>
      The pattern on the left side has two matchable places named _x. This instructs <i>Yacas</i> to check that they are the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next we tell the system that if you take a derivative of a function with respect to a variable that that function does not depend
      on, the result is zero. Taking the derivative of say f(y) with respect to x would yield the result zero, assuming that f(y) does
      not depend on x.
<pre>
dd(_x,y_IsFreeOf(x)) &lt;-- 0;
</pre>
      Note the construct y_IsFreeOf(x). <i>Yacas</i> internally transforms that construct to mean IsFreeOf(x,y). So this pattern matches only
      if the expression to take the derivative off does not depend on the variable to take the derivative with respect of. The result is 
      zero in that case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking derivatives is a linear operation. The derivative of an expression that adds two expressions is the derivative of the one plus
      the derivative of the other. This is summarized in the following rules:
<pre>
dd(_x,_a + _b)  &lt;-- dd(x,a)+dd(x,b);
dd(_x,_a - _b)  &lt;-- dd(x,a)-dd(x,b);
dd(_x,   - _b)  &lt;--        -dd(x,b);
</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking the derivative of a function to the power of a constant is also a well-known transform. Taking the derivative of x^n with respect to
      x yields n*x^(n-1). This can be generalized to taking the derivative of f(x)^n by applying the chain rule: d(x,f(g(x))) is d(x,g)*d(g,f),
      symbolically. We will embed the chain rule within the transformation rules:
<pre>
dd(_x,_y ^ z_IsFreeOf(x)) &lt;-- dd(x,y)*z*y^(z-1);
</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking the derivative of an expression that consists of one expression multiplied by the other also has a commonly known transformation rule:
<pre>
dd(_x,_a * _b)  &lt;-- a*dd(x,b)+dd(x,a)*b;
</pre>
      And so does division:
<pre>
dd(x,_y / _z) &lt;-- (z*dd(x,y)-y*dd(x,z))/z^2;
</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally we add the derivatives of a few well-known analytic functions:
<pre>
dd(_x,Sin(_y)) &lt;--  dd(x,y)*Cos(y);
dd(_x,Cos(_y)) &lt;-- -dd(x,y)*Sin(y);
dd(_x,Exp(_y)) &lt;--  dd(x,y)*Exp(y);
</pre>
      This list can be expanded further of course.
