    <h1>Fun with derivatives part 1: defining the concept of a derivative in <i>Yacas</i></h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      On this page you can use the code developed for the accompanying article, which defines a function dd that can take
      the derivative of a function. The function dd takes as first argument a variable, and as second argument an expression
      to determine the derivative of. Clicking on <a class="commandlink">dd(x,Sin(x))</a> should readily give you the answer
      Cos(x) in the Yacas calculation center on the right half of this page. You can also type in expressions yourself in the
      calculation center. For that you have to click on that part of the page so the calculation center starts receiving your
      key input.
    </p>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>
      Here are a few more simple examples. 
      <ul>
        <li><a class="commandlink">dd(x,x)</a></li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">dd(x,a)</a></li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">dd(x,a*x)</a></li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">dd(x,a*x^2)</a></li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">dd(x,Sin(x)+x)</a></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The beauty of derivatives is that you can make the expressions arbitrarily complex, and still take its derivative, although 
      this might start to take up a lot of time from the computer (but probably still less time than if you did it yourself by hand). 
      <ul>
        <li><a class="commandlink">dd(x,a*x^n)</a></li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">dd(x,Sin(a*x))</a></li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">dd(x,1-a*x^Sqrt(2))</a></li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">dd(x,Exp(1+Sin(a*x)))</a></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      You can verify that the above examples return the same result as the function D built in to <i>Yacas</i>.
      For example
      <ul>
        <li><a class="commandlink">dd(x,Exp(1+Sin(a*x)))</a></li>
      </ul>
      and
      <ul>
        <li><a class="commandlink"><a class="commandlink">D(x) Exp(1+Sin(a*x))</a></a></li>
      </ul>
      should give the same results.
    </p>
    <h2>Extending the program</h2>
    <p>
      You can extend the code yourself to handle other functions not covered yet, by going to <a class="editexample">this page.</a>
      An interesting example is the derivative of Sqrt(x) (the square root of x), which can be defined as:
      <pre>
dd(_x,Sqrt(_y)) <-- dd(x,y)/Sqrt(y);
      </pre>
but also as
      <pre>
dd(_x,Sqrt(_y)) <-- (1/2)*y^(1/2-1)*dd(x,y);
      </pre>
      If you were to try these out with dd(x,Sqrt(x));, and then repeatedly calling dd(x,%), you would see the size of the resulting
      expressions grow much faster when using the first transformation rule than when using the second one.
