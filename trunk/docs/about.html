YACAS is an easy to use, general purpose Computer Algebra System, a program for symbolic 
manipulation of mathematical expressions. It uses its own programming language designed for 
symbolic as well as arbitrary-precision numerical computations. The system has a library of 
scripts that implement many of the symbolic algebra operations; new algorithms can be easily 
added to the library. YACAS comes with extensive documentation (hundreds of pages) covering the 
scripting language, the functionality that is already implemented in the system, and the 
algorithms we used.<br />
