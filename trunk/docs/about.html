YACAS is an easy to use, general purpose Computer Algebra System, a program for symbolic 
manipulation of mathematical expressions. It uses its own programming language designed for 
symbolic as well as arbitrary-precision numerical computations. The system has a library of 
scripts that implement many of the symbolic algebra operations; new algorithms can be easily 
added to the library. YACAS comes with extensive documentation (320+ pages) covering the 
scripting language, the functionality that is already implemented in the system, and the 
algorithms we used.<br /> This  entire site (including the documentation) can also be found
