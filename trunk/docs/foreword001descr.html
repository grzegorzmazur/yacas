    <h1>Foreword</h1>
    <p>
      You have here in front of you the new and improved <i>Yacas</i> web site. The change was 
      inspired by the Web 2.0 ideas. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Web 2.0 appears to stand on two legs. The one leg is interactivity
      of web sites (using Javascript and Ajax) to make web sites more interactive. 
      Pages don't have to reload, but will seem to run inside the browser as a separate
      application. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The other leg is gathering content contributed to systems for free by volunteers.
      Examples are Wiki, Google, but also open source projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one leg makes it easy for people to do things (they don't have to install any
      software), the other is about making a system more valuable by getting people to 
      help add information.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not different from what many open source projects try to do. With <i>Yacas</i>
      for example the idea was to make it open source and try to seduce other people to help
      extend the system. However, up until now not much thought had been given to making
      it easy for volunteers to help out by contributing code. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us see how that works out. First, we aim for people who enjoy doing calculations, perhaps
      1% of population. From that small group, people needed to have an affinity with Unix systems,
      and be able to download and compile and install programs themselves, say 1% of the previous small 
      group. Now before they can even start to use <i>Yacas</i>, they have to learn a new programming
      language (the <i>Yacas</i> scripting language). Then they have to think of something to do with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that is just if they want to use <i>Yacas</i>. Now if they want to <i>contribute</i>, it
      gets worse. They have to start using and be comfortable with cvs and ssh, get an account
      at sourceforge (will take a day to process), and then get me to give them write permissions
      to the sourceforge cvs repository. And only <i>then</i> can they start to contribute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given the above, it is a miracle at all that people beat a path to <i>Yacas</i> and contributed to it.
      The new web site aims to change all this by making it a lot easier for people to contribute. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To redesign the site we used a model user, and thought about how he would interact with <i>Yacas</i>.
      We imagine this user to be a university student with time on his hands and an eagerness to learn
      something new. This student doesn't just want to read about math in an abstract way, but be able
      to also quickly write a little program to try it out. We further imagine that this model user 
      probably already has a calculation in mind. What would the user do? He will probably go to Google.
      This means the web site should be discoverable easily through Google, and the deep links from 
      Google should work well (make sure that if some one does a deep link he gets the full <i>Yacas</i>
      web site any way). If this model user already knows about <i>Yacas</i> she might go to the site
      directly. But most people are assumed to land on the <i>Yacas</i> page through a search engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      So here we are. We have a model user, student, wanting to do a specific calculation. He went to 
      Google, and Google directed him to us. He should land in the page that shows how the calculation 
      can be done in <i>Yacas</i>, and be able to immediately try it out. One of the nice advantages 
      of <i>Yacas</i> is that it has a small footprint and the Java version can thus easily run from 
      within a browser. We used Javascript as glue between the web pages and the Java applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the user knows about <i>Yacas</i> she might go to the site directly. The web site should then be
      structured so that she can easily find an example of the kind of calculation she is interested in.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is only after this model user has discovered that <i>Yacas</i> can be useful for her that she
      might consider investing some time in discovering more about <i>Yacas</i> by reading the manual
      or background information. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The model user might even want to try her hand at writing a little program herself to do a calculation.
      She can do so on our new web site, where it is now possible to edit a program before it gets
      loaded in to the Java applet. This is how experienced users tend to work; they edit code, run it,
      edit it, run it, rinse and repeat, until they are satisfied with the result. The combination of a text
      editor and command line console is an user interface also. With the web site we hope to improve on
      that user interface in such a way as to not alienate experienced developers, while making it easier
      for newcomers to jump right in. The user interface should be easy to understand for newcomers but
      not be in the way of experienced users (as we of course hope to turn newcomers in to experienced users 
      quickly).
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the user has not installed anything <i>Yacas</i>-related
      up until now! She might have had to install Java (the web site warns about that extensively if that
      is needed, we really do want to guide people to our online version of <i>Yacas</i>), but that 
      should be it. Most browsers now support Javascript, and if the visitor does not have Javascript
      she will probably also not be interested in an online application in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what about our valuable loyal early adopters? First of all they can now work online like they
      always worked off-line (editing code and then running it), use the additional help tools online,
      but they can also still download the off-line version. The old site is still available, and you can
      still do everything you could do in the past. The off-line version will always be central to the
      system, even if only because it is part of the build process.
    </p>
    <p>
      We started with the observation that Web 2.0 stands on two legs. One is making it easier to use something
      through the use of Javascript on a web site. We discussed that. But what about the other leg? 
    </p>
    <p>
      The other leg is gathering contributions from volunteers. In business they would call it "capturing value",
      not far off, the system does become more valuable, only not in monetary terms, as <i>Yacas</i> 
      is not sold. But the more people use it and contribute to it, the more useful it becomes for 
      everyone. After long thought we arrived at the idea of having a refereed journal (refereed for now
      by the author of this article), where people can contribute articles on nice calculations one can
      do with <i>Yacas</i> . The article then gets added to the <i>Yacas</i> distribution, meaning it will
      be part of the web site but also the source download. When this becomes bigger we might want to consider
      scaling this by having more volunteer referees check for submissions. For now this is a nice and easy
      way of doing things, one where we don't have to have a dynamic server. The whole site can now still run as 
      a static web site.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Yacas</i> system can now be thought of as consisting of two parts; the core which is maintained
      by a few knowledged persons, and the more visible part that contains lots of contributions (hopefully!)
      of examples of calculations done with <i>Yacas</i>.
    </p>

      We hope you enjoy your stay on this web site, and find it useful. If you get stuck somewhere, or some
      part is unclear, please feel free to
