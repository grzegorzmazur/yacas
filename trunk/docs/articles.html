YACAS is an easy to use, general purpose Computer Algebra System, a program for symbolic 
manipulation of mathematical expressions. It uses its own programming language designed for 
symbolic as well as arbitrary-precision numerical computations. The system has a library of 
scripts that implement many of the symbolic algebra operations; new algorithms can be easily 
added to the library. YACAS comes with extensive documentation (hundreds of pages) covering the 
scripting language, the functionality that is already implemented in the system, and the 
algorithms we used.

          Newton iteration is a natural fit for computer algebra systems because you can use the symbolic facilities first
          to take the derivative of a function, and then later on use the arbitrary-precision numeric support to get a very
          accurate numeric approximation (starting from a sufficiently close guess). Newton iteration can converge very fast,
          which you can see in action in this article.

The original idea behind open-sourcing Yacas was always to try to get people to help extend it. My reasoning was that if I wanted such a system, other people were bound to also want it. Wouldn't it be great if all those people helped me extend Yacas, instead of them starting their own system? All I had to do is stop them from starting their own project and work on mine instead. They would thus extend Yacas, improve on it, making the system more valuable as a whole to every one else including me. So Yacas started life as an open-source project, and people did come to help.

        <p>
In retrospect it is a wonder that people came to help at all! Consider the effort one has to take in order to be able to contribute to Yacas.
