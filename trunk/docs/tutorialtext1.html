    <h1>Introduction to <i>Yacas</i>: tutorial and examples</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      <i>Yacas</i> allows you to do calculations, and can be used directly inside your browser. Above 
      you should see the <i>Yacas</i> calculation environment, with a text in blue stating "Click here to enter an expression". 
      After tapping in that area, that text should be replaced with <span class="yacasExpression">In></span>. You can type an expression to
      be executed here. If you don't know what to type don't worry, that is what this tutorial is for.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this tutorial you will also see highlighted underlined text. Clicking on it invokes a calculation. 
      For example, to get the result of adding one to one, you could click here: <a class="commandlink">1+1</a> 
      (The calculation might take a few seconds the first time you click). Below in the calculation box you will 
      then see <span class="yacasExpression">In> 1+1</span> and a line following it with <span class="yacasExpression">Out> 2</span>. 
      You can (and usually will) type it in manually in the calculation
      environment, but in this tutorial you can click on the links to perform the action. The above is obviously a simple example, but <i>Yacas</i>
      is capable of doing calculations that are a lot more complex. This tutorial should get you started
      in a few hours.
    </p>

    <h2>The <i>Yacas</i> syntax</h2>
    <p>
      Syntax is very important. It helps you read code or expressions, and sometimes even guides the way you think about a problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Expressions in <i>Yacas</i> are generally built up of words. We will not bore you with the exact definitions of such words, 
      but roughly speaking they are either sequences of alphabetic letters, or a number, or a bracket, or space to separate words, or
      a word built up from symbols like <span class="yacasExpression">+, -. *, &lt;</span>, etcetera. If you want, you can mix these different types of characters, by surrounding
      them with quotes. Thus, <a class="commandlink">"This text"</a> is what is called one token, surrounded by quotes, in <i>Yacas</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The usual notation people use when writing down a calculation is called the infix notation, and you can readily recognize it, as for example 
      <a class="commandlink">2+3</a> and <a class="commandlink">3*4</a>. Prefix operators also exist. These operators come before an expression, like 
      for example the unary minus sign (called unary because it accepts one argument), <a class="commandlink">-(3*4)</a>. In addition to prefix
      operators there are also postfix operators, like the exclamation mark to calculate the factorial of a number, <a class="commandlink">10!</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Yacas</i> understands standard simple arithmetic expressions. Some examples:
      <ul>
        <li><a class="commandlink">2+3</a> (addition)</li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">2*3</a> (multiplication)</li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">2-3</a> (subtraction)</li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">2^3</a> (raising powers)</li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">2+3*4</a></li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">(2+3)*4</a></li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">6/3</a> (division)</li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">1/3</a></li>
      </ul>
      Divisions are not reduced to real numbers, but kept as a rational for as long as possible, since the 
      rational is an exact correct expression (and any real number would just be an approximation. <i>Yacas</i>
      is able to change a rational in to a number with the function <span class="yacasExpression">N</span>, for example <a class="commandlink">N(1/3)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Operators have "precedence", meaning that certain operations are done first before others are done. For example, in <a class="commandlink">2+3*4</a>
      the multiplication is performed before the addition. The usual way to change the order of a calculation is with round brackets. 
      The round brackets in the expression <a class="commandlink">(2+3)*4</a> will force <i>Yacas</i> to first add 2 and 3, and then multiply the 
      result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simple function calls have their arguments between round brackets, separated by commas. Examples are <a class="commandlink">Sin(Pi)</a> (which
      indicates that you are interested in the value of the trigonometric function sin applied to the constant pi),
      and <a class="commandlink">Min(5,1,3,-5,10)</a> (which should return the lowest of its arguments, <span class="yacasExpression">-5</span> in this case).
      Functions usually have the form <span class="yacasExpression">f()</span>, <span class="yacasExpression">f(x)</span> or <span class="yacasExpression">f(x,y,z,...)</span> 
      depending on how many arguments the function accepts. Functions always return a result. 
      For example, <a class="commandlink">Cos(0)</a> should return <span class="yacasExpression">1</span>. Evaluating functions can be thought of as simplifying an expression as much
      as possible. Sometimes further simplification is not possible and a function returns itself unsimplified, like taking the square root of
      an integer <a class="commandlink">Sqrt(2)</a>. A reduction to a number would be an approximation. We explain elsewhere how to get <i>Yacas</i>
      to simplify an expression to a number.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Yacas</i> allows for use of the infix notation, but with some additions. Functions can be "bodied", meaning that the
      last argument is written past the close bracket. An example is <span class="yacasExpression">ForEach</span>, where we write <a class="commandlink">ForEach(item, 1 .. 10) Echo(item);</a>.
      <span class="yacasExpression">Echo(item)</span> is the last argument to the function <span class="yacasExpression">ForEach</span>. 
      <br />
      A list is enclosed with curly braces, and is written out with commas between the elements, like for example <a class="commandlink">{1,2,3}</a>. 
      items in lists (and things that can be made to look like lists, like arrays and strings), can then be accessed by indicating the index between
      square brackets after the object. <a class="commandlink">{a,b,c}[2]</a> should return <span class="yacasExpression">b</span>, as 
      <span class="yacasExpression">b</span> is the second element in the list (<i>Yacas</i>
      starts counting from 1 when accessing elements). The same can be done with strings: <a class="commandlink">"abc"[2]</a>.
      <br />
      And finally, function calls can be grouped together, where they get executed one at a time, and the result of executing the last expression is
      returned. This is done through square brackets, as <a class="commandlink">[ Echo("Hello"); Echo("World"); True; ];</a>, which first writes
      <span class="yacasExpression">Hello</span> to screen, then <span class="yacasExpression">World</span> on the next line, and then returns <span class="yacasExpression">True</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you type in an expression, you have to take in to account the fact that <i>Yacas</i> is case-sensitive. This means that a function <span class="yacasExpression">sin</span> 
      (with all lowercase) is a different function from <span class="yacasExpression">Sin</span> (which starts with a capital s), and the variable <span class="yacasExpression">v</span> 
      is a different one from <span class="yacasExpression">V</span>.
    </p>
    <h2>Using <i>Yacas</i> from the calculation center</h2>
    <p>
      As mentioned earlier, you can type in commands on the command line in the calculation center. Typically, you would enter one statement per line, 
      for example, click on <a class="commandlink">Sin(Pi/2);</a>. The has a memory, and remembers results from calculations performed before. 
      For example, if you define a function on a line (or set a variable to a value), the defined function (or variable) are available to be used
      in following lines. A session can be restarted (forgetting all previous definitions and results) by typing <a class="commandlink">restart</a>. 
      All memory is erased in that case. 
    </p>
	<p>
      Statements should end with a semicolon <span class="yacasExpression">;</span> although this is not required in interactive sessions
      (<i>Yacas</i> will append a semicolon at end of line to finish the statement).
    </p>
    <p>
      The command line has a history list, so it should be easy to
      browse through the expressions you entered previously using the up and down arrow keys. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When a few characters have been typed, the command line will use
      the characters before the cursor as a filter into the history,
      and allow you to browse through all the commands in the history
      that start with these characters quickly, instead of browsing through
      the entire history. If the system recognized the first few characters,
      it will also show the commands that start with the sequence entered. You 
      can use the arrow keys to browse through this list, and then select the 
      intended function to be inserted by pressing enter. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Commands spanning multiple lines can (and actually have to) be entered by 
      using a trailing backslash \ at end of each continued line. For example,
      clicking on <a class="commandlink">2+3+</a> will result in an error,
      but entering the same with a backslash at the end and then entering another 
      expression will concatenate the two lines and evaluate the concatenated input.
    </p>
    <p>
      Incidentally, any text <i>Yacas</i> prints without a prompt is either a message printed by a 
      function as a side-effect, or an error message. Resulting values of expressions 
      are always printed after an <span class="yacasExpression">Out></span> prompt.
    </p>

    <h2><i>Yacas</i> as a symbolic calculator</h2>
    <p>
      We are ready to try some calculations. <i>Yacas</i> uses a 
      C-like infix syntax and is case-sensitive. Here are some 
      exact manipulations with fractions for a start:
      <a class="commandlink">1/14+5/21*(30-(1+1/2)*5^2);</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The standard scripts already contain a simple math library for symbolic simplification of basic 
      algebraic functions. Any names such as x are treated as independent, symbolic variables and are 
      not evaluated by default. Some examples to try: 
      <ul>
        <li><a class="commandlink">0+x</a></li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">x+1*y</a></li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">Sin(ArcSin(alpha))+Tan(ArcTan(beta))</a></li>
      </ul>
      Note that the answers are not just simple numbers here, but actual expressions. This is 
      where <i>Yacas</i> shines. It was built specifically to do calculations that have expressions
      as answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <i>Yacas</i> after a calculation is done, you can refer to the previous result with <span class="yacasExpression">%</span>. For example,
      we could first type <a class="commandlink">(x+1)*(x-1)</a>, and then decide we would like to see
      a simpler version of that expression, and thus type <a class="commandlink">Simplify(%)</a>, which 
      should result in <span class="yacasExpression">x^2-1</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The special operator <a class="commandlink">%</a> automatically recalls the result from the previous line. 
      The function Simplify attempts to reduce an expression to a simpler form. Note that standard function names 
      in <i>Yacas</i> are typically capitalized. Multiple capitalization such as <span class="yacasExpression">ArcSin</span> is sometimes used. The 
      underscore character <span class="yacasExpression">_</span> is a reserved operator symbol and cannot be part of variable or function names.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Yacas</i> offers some more powerful symbolic manipulation operations. A few will be shown here to wetten
      the appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some simple equation solving algorithms are in place:
      <ul>
        <li><a class="commandlink">Solve(x/(1+x) == a, x);</a></li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">Solve(x^2+x == 0, x);</a></li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">Solve(a+x*y==z,x);</a></li>
      </ul>
     (Note the use of the <span class="yacasExpression">==</span> operator, which does not evaluate to anything, to denote an "equation" object.) 
    </p>
    <p>
      Taylor series are supported, for example: <a class="commandlink">Taylor(x,0,3) Exp(x)</a> is a bodied operator
      that expands <span class="yacasExpression">Exp(x)</span> for <span class="yacasExpression">x</span> around <span class="yacasExpression">x=0</span>, up to order 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      Symbolic manipulation is the main application of <i>Yacas</i>. This is a small tour of the capabilities <i>Yacas</i> 
      currently offers. Note that this list of examples is far from complete. <i>Yacas</i> contains a few hundred commands, 
      of which only a few are shown here.
      <ul>
        <li><a class="commandlink">Expand((1+x)^5);</a> (expand the expression into a polynomial)</li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">Limit(x,0) Sin(x)/x;</a> (calculate the limit of <span class="yacasExpression">Sin(x)/x</span> as <span class="yacasExpression">x</span> approaches zero)</li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">Newton(Sin(x),x,3,0.0001);</a> (use Newton's method to find the value of <span class="yacasExpression">x</span> near 3 where <span class="yacasExpression">Sin(x)</span> equals zero, numerically, and stop if the result is closer than <span class="yacasExpression">0.0001</span> to the real result)</li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">DiagonalMatrix({a,b,c});</a> (create a matrix with the elements specified in the vector on the diagonal)</li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">Integrate(x,a,b) x*Sin(x);</a> (integrate a function over variable <span class="yacasExpression">x</span>, from <span class="yacasExpression">a</span> to <span class="yacasExpression">b</span>)</li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">Factor(x^2-1);</a> (factorize a polynomial)</li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">Apart(1/(x^2-1),x);</a> (create a partial fraction expansion of a polynomial)</li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">Simplify((x^2-1)/(x-1));</a> (simplification of expressions)</li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">CanProve( (a And b) Or (a And Not b) );</a> (special-purpose simplifier that tries to simplify boolean expressions as much as possible)</li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">TrigSimpCombine(Cos(a)*Sin(b));</a> (special-purpose simplifier that tries to transform trigonometric expressions into a form where there are only additions of trigonometric functions involved and no multiplications)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Arbitrary precision numbers</h2>
    <p>
      <i>Yacas</i> can deal with arbitrary precision numbers. It can work with large integers,
      like <a class="commandlink">20!</a> (The ! means factorial, thus <span class="yacasExpression">1*2*3*...*20</span>).
    </p>
    <p>
      As we saw before, rational numbers will stay rational as long as the numerator and denominator
      are integers, so <a class="commandlink">55/10</a> will evaluate to <span class="yacasExpression">11/2</span>. You can override this
      behavior by using the numerical evaluation function <span class="yacasExpression">N()</span>. For example,
      <a class="commandlink">N(55/10)</a> will evaluate to <span class="yacasExpression">5.5</span> . This behavior holds for most math
      functions. <i>Yacas</i> will try to maintain an exact answer (in terms of integers or
      fractions) instead of using floating point numbers, unless <span class="yacasExpression">N()</span> is used. Where
      the value for the constant pi is needed, use the built-in variable <span class="yacasExpression">Pi</span>. It
      will be replaced by the (approximate) numerical value when <a class="commandlink">N(Pi)</a> is called.
      <i>Yacas</i> knows some simplification rules using <span class="yacasExpression">Pi</span> (especially with trigonometric
      functions). 
    </p>
    <p>
      The function <span class="yacasExpression">N</span> takes either one or two arguments. It evaluates its first argument and tries to 
      reduce it as much as possible to a real-valued approximation of the expression. If the second argument
      is present, it states the number of digits precision required. Thus <a class="commandlink">N(1/234)</a>
      returns a number with the current default precision (which starts at 20 digits), but you can request
      as many digits as you like by passing a second argument, as in <a class="commandlink">N(1/234, 10)</a>, 
      <a class="commandlink">N(1/234, 20)</a>, <a class="commandlink">N(1/234, 30)</a>, etcetera.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that we need to enter <span class="yacasExpression">N()</span> to force the approximate calculation, otherwise the fraction would have been left 
      unevaluated. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Revisiting <span class="yacasExpression">Pi</span>, we can get as many digits of <span class="yacasExpression">Pi</span> as we like, by providing the 
      precision required as argument to <span class="yacasExpression">N</span>.
      So to get 50 digits precision, we can evaluate <a class="commandlink">N(Pi,50)</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taking a derivative of a function was amongst the very first of symbolic calculations to be performed
      by a computer, as the operation lends itself surprisingly well to being performed automatically. Naturally,
      it is also implemented in <i>Yacas</i>, through the function <span class="yacasExpression">D</span>. 
      <span class="yacasExpression">D</span> is a <i>bodied</i> function, meaning
      that its last argument is past the closing brackets. Where normal functions are called with syntax similar
      to <span class="yacasExpression">f(x,y,z)</span>, a bodied function would be called with a syntax 
      <span class="yacasExpression">f(x,y)z</span>. Here are two examples of taking a derivative:
      <ul>
        <li><a class="commandlink">D(x) Sin(x);</a> (taking a derivative)</li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">D(x) D(x) Sin(x);</a> (taking a derivative twice)</li>
      </ul>
        The {D} function also accepts an argument specifying how often
        the derivative has to be taken. In that case, the above expressions
        can also be written as:
      <ul>
        <li><a class="commandlink">D(x,1) Sin(x);</a> (taking a derivative)</li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">D(x,2) Sin(x);</a> (taking a derivative twice)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
 
    <h2>Analytic functions</h2>
    <p>
      Many of the usual analytic functions have been defined in the <i>Yacas</i> library. Examples are
      <a class="commandlink">Exp(1)</a>, <a class="commandlink">Sin(2)</a>, <a class="commandlink">ArcSin(1/2)</a>,
      <a class="commandlink">Sqrt(2)</a>.
      These will not evaluate to a numeric result in general, unless the result is an integer, like 
      <a class="commandlink">Sqrt(4)</a>. If asked to reduce the result to a numeric approximation with
      the function <span class="yacasExpression">N</span>, then <i>Yacas will do so</i>, as for example in <a class="commandlink">N(Sqrt(2),50)</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <p>
      <i>Yacas</i> supports variables. You can set the value of a variable with the <span class="yacasExpression">:=</span> infix operator,
      as in <a class="commandlink">a:=1;</a>. The variable can then be used in expressions, and everywhere
      where it is referred to, it will be replaced by its value, <a class="commandlink">a</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To clear a variable binding, execute <a class="commandlink">Clear(a);</a>.  
      A variable will evaluate to itself after a call to clear it (so after the call to clear <span class="yacasExpression">a</span>
      above, calling <span class="commandlink">a</span> should now return <span class="yacasExpression">a</span>).
      This is one of the properties of the evaluation scheme of <i>Yacas</i>; when some 
      object can not be evaluated or transformed any further, it is returned as the final result.
    </p>

    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <p>
      The <span class="yacasExpression">:=</span> operator can also be used to define simple functions: <a class="commandlink">f(x):=2*x*x</a>.
      will define a new function, <span class="yacasExpression">f</span>, that accepts one argument and returns twice the square of that argument.
      This function can now be called, <a class="commandlink">f(a)</a>. You can change the definition of a function
      by defining it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      One and the same function name such as <span class="yacasExpression">f</span> may define different functions if they take different 
      numbers of arguments. One can define a function <span class="yacasExpression">f</span> which takes one argument, as for example 
      <a class="commandlink">f(x):=x^2;</a>, or two arguments, <a class="commandlink">f(x,y):=x*y;</a>.
      If you clicked on both links, both functions should now be defined, and <a class="commandlink">f(a)</a>
      calls the one function whereas <a class="commandlink">f(a,b)</a> calls the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Yacas</i> is very flexible when it comes to types of mathematical objects. Functions can in general
      accept or return any type of argument.
    </p>

    <h2>Boolean expressions and predicates</h2>
    <p>
      <i>Yacas</i> predefines <span class="yacasExpression">True</span> and <span class="yacasExpression">False</span> as boolean values. Functions returning boolean values are 
      called <i>predicates</i>. For example, <span class="yacasExpression">IsNumber()</span> and<span class="yacasExpression"> IsInteger()</span> are predicates defined in the 
      <i>Yacas</i> environment. For example, try <a class="commandlink">IsNumber(2+x);</a>, or 
      <a class="commandlink">IsInteger(15/5);</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also comparison operators. Typing <span class="commandlink">2 &gt; 1</span> would return <span class="yacasExpression">True</span>. You can also use the infix operators
      <span class="yacasExpression">And</span> and <span class="yacasExpression">Or</span>, and the prefix operator 
      <span class="yacasExpression">Not</span>, to make more complex boolean expressions. For example, try <a class="commandlink">True And False</a>, 
      <a class="commandlink">True Or False</a>, <a class="commandlink">True And Not(False)</a>.
    </p>

	<h2>Strings and lists</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to numbers and variables, <i>Yacas</i> supports strings and lists. Strings are simply sequences of 
      characters enclosed by double quotes, for example: <a class="commandlink">"this is a string with \"quotes\" in it"</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lists are ordered groups of items, as usual. <i>Yacas</i> represents lists by putting the objects between braces 
      and separating them with commas. The list consisting of objects a, b, and c could be entered by typing <a class="commandlink">{a,b,c}</a>. 
      In <i>Yacas</i>, vectors are represented as lists and matrices as lists of lists. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Items in a list can be accessed through the <span class="yacasExpression">[ ]</span> operator. The first element has index one. Examples: when you enter
      <a class="commandlink">uu:={a,b,c,d,e,f};</a> then <a class="commandlink">uu[2];</a> evaluates to <span class="yacasExpression">b</span>, and
      <a class="commandlink">uu[2 .. 4];</a> evaluates to <span class="yacasExpression">{b,c,d}</span>. The "range" expression <a class="commandlink">2 .. 4</a>
      evaluates to <span class="yacasExpression">{2,3,4}</span>. Note that spaces around the <span class="yacasExpression">..</span> operator are necessary, or else the parser will not be able to 
      distinguish it from a part of a number.
    </p>      
    <p>
      Lists evaluate their arguments, and return a list with results of evaluating each element. So, 
      typing <a class="commandlink">{1+2,3};</a> would evaluate to <span class="yacasExpression">{3,3}</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of using lists to represent expressions dates back to the language LISP developed in the 1970's. From a
      small set of operations on lists, very powerful symbolic manipulation algorithms can be built. Lists can also be used 
      as function arguments when a variable number of arguments are necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's try some list operations now. First click on <a class="commandlink">m:={a,b,c};</a> to set up an initial
      list to work on. Then click on links below:
      <ul>
        <li><a class="commandlink">Length(m);</a> (return the length of a list)</li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">Reverse(m);</a> (return the string reversed)</li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">Concat(m,m);</a> (concatenate two strings)</li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">m[1]:=d;</a> (setting the first element of the list to a new value, d, as can be verified by
        evaluating <a class="commandlink">m</a>)</li>
      </ul>
      Many more list operations are described in the reference manual.

    <h2>Writing simplification rules</h2>
    <p>
      Mathematical calculations require versatile transformations on symbolic
      quantities. Instead of trying to define all possible transformations, <i>Yacas</i>
      provides a simple and easy to use pattern matching scheme for manipulating
      expressions according to user-defined <i>rules</i>. <i>Yacas</i> itself is designed 
      as a small core engine executing a large library of rules to match and replace patterns. 
    </p>
    <p>
      One simple application of pattern-matching rules is to define new
      functions. (This is actually the only way <i>Yacas</i> can learn about new
      functions.) As an example, let's define a function <span class="yacasExpression">f</span> that will evaluate
      factorials of non-negative integers. We will define a predicate to
      check whether our argument is indeed a non-negative integer, and we will use
      this predicate and the obvious recursion <span class="yacasExpression">f(n)=n*f(n-1) if n>0 and 1 if n=0</span>
      to evaluate the factorial. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We start with the simple termination condition, which is that <span class="yacasExpression">f(n)</span> should return one if <span class="yacasExpression">n</span> is zero:
      <ul>
        <li><a class="commandlink">10 # f(0) &lt;-- 1;</a></li>
      </ul>
      You can verify that this already works for input value
      zero, with <a class="commandlink">f(0)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we come to the more complex line,
      <ul>
        <li><a class="commandlink">20 # f(n_IsIntegerGreaterThanZero) &lt;-- n*f(n-1);</a></li>
      </ul>
      Now we realize we need a function <span class="yacasExpression">IsGreaterThanZero</span>, so we define this function, with 
      
      <ul>
        <li><a class="commandlink">IsIntegerGreaterThanZero(_n) &lt;-- (IsInteger(n) And n&gt;0);</a></li>
      </ul>
      You can verify that it works by trying <a class="commandlink">f(5)</a>, which should return 
      the same value as <a class="commandlink">5!</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the above example we have first defined two "simplification rules" for a new function <span class="yacasExpression">f()</span>. Then
      we realized that we need to define a predicate <span class="yacasExpression">IsIntegerGreaterThanZero()</span>. A
      predicate equivalent to <span class="yacasExpression">IsIntegerGreaterThanZero()</span> is actually already
      defined in the standard library and it's called <span class="yacasExpression">IsPositiveInteger</span>, so it was
      not necessary, strictly speaking, to define our own predicate to do the same
      thing. We did it here just for illustration purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first two lines recursively define a factorial function <span class="yacasExpression">f(n)=n*(n-1)*...*1</span>. The rules are given
      precedence values 10 and 20, so the first rule will be applied first.
      Incidentally, the factorial is also defined in the standard library as a postfix
      operator ! and it is bound to an internal routine much faster than the
      recursion in our example. The example does show how to create your own routine with a few lines of 
      code. One of the design goals of <i>Yacas</i> was to allow precisely that, definition of a
      new function with very little effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The operator <span class="yacasExpression">&lt;--</span> defines a rule to be applied to a specific 
      function. (The <span class="yacasExpression">&lt;--</span> operation cannot be applied to an atom.)
      The <span class="yacasExpression">_n</span> in the rule for <span class="yacasExpression">IsIntegerGreaterThanZero()</span> specifies that any object which happens to be
      the argument of that predicate is matched and assigned to the local
      variable <span class="yacasExpression">n</span>. The expression to the right of <span class="yacasExpression">&lt;--</span> can use n (without the underscore) as a variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we consider the rules for the function <span class="yacasExpression">f</span>. The first rule just specifies that <span class="yacasExpression">f(0)</span> should be replaced 
      by 1 in any expression. The second rule is a little more involved.
      <span class="yacasExpression">n_IsIntegerGreaterThanZero</span> is a match for the argument of <span class="yacasExpression">f</span>, with the proviso that the predicate 
      <span class="yacasExpression">IsIntegerGreaterThanZero(n)</span> should return <span class="yacasExpression">True</span>, otherwise the pattern is not matched. The underscore
      operator is to be used only on the left hand side of the rule definition operator <span class="yacasExpression">&lt;--</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is another, slightly longer but equivalent way of writing the second rule:
      <ul>
        <li><a class="commandlink">20 # f(_n)_(IsIntegerGreaterThanZero(n)) &lt;-- n*f(n-1);</a></li>
      </ul>
	
      The underscore after the function object denotes a "postpredicate" that should return 
      <span class="yacasExpression">True</span> or else there is no match. This predicate may be a complicated expression involving several 
      logical operations, unlike the simple checking of just one predicate in the <span class="yacasExpression">n_IsIntegerGreaterThanZero</span>
      construct. The postpredicate can also use the variable <span class="yacasExpression">n</span> (without the underscore).
    </p>
    <p>
      Precedence values for rules are given by a number followed by the <span class="yacasExpression">#</span> infix operator (and the transformation rule after it). This number determines 
      the ordering of precedence for the pattern matching rules, with 0 the lowest allowed precedence value, 
      i.e. rules with precedence 0 will be tried first. Multiple rules can have the same number: this just 
      means that it doesn't matter what order these patterns are tried in. If no number is supplied, 0
      is assumed. In our example, the rule <span class="yacasExpression">f(0) &lt;-- 1<span class="yacasExpression"> must be applied earlier than the recursive rule, 
      or else the recursion will never terminate. But as long as there are no other rules concerning the function
      <span class="yacasExpression">f</span>, the assignment of numbers 10 and 20 is arbitrary, and they could have been 500 and 501 just as well.
      It is usually a good idea however to keep some space between these numbers, so you have room to insert
      new transformation rules later on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Predicates can be combined: for example, {IsIntegerGreaterThanZero()} could also have been defined as:
      <ul>
        <li><a class="commandlink">10 # IsIntegerGreaterThanZero(n_IsInteger)_(n&gt;0) &lt;-- True;</a></li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">20 # IsIntegerGreaterThanZero(_n) &lt;-- False;</a></li>
      </ul>
      The first rule specifies that if n is an integer, and is greater than zero, the result is <span class="yacasExpression">True</span>, and the 
      second rule states that otherwise (when the rule with precedence 10 did not apply) the predicate returns <span class="yacasExpression">False</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the above example, the expression <span class="yacasExpression">n &gt; 0</span> is added after the pattern and allows the pattern to match only 
      if this predicate return <span class="yacasExpression">True</span>. This is a useful syntax for defining rules with complicated predicates. There is 
      no difference between the rules<span class="yacasExpression"> F(n_IsPositiveInteger) &lt;--...</span> and <span class="yacasExpression">F(_n)_(IsPositiveInteger(n)) &lt;-- ...</span>
      except that the first syntax is a little more concise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The left hand side of a rule expression has the following form:
      <br />
     <span class="yacasExpression"><i>precedence</i> # <i>pattern</i> _ <i>postpredicate</i> &lt;-- <i>replacement</i> ; </span>
      <br />
      The optional <i>precedence</i> must be a positive integer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some more examples of rules (not made clickable because their equivalents are already in the basic <i>Yacas</i> library):
      <ul>
        <li><span class="yacasExpression">10 # _x + 0 &lt;-- x;</span></li>
        <li><span class="yacasExpression">20 # _x - _x &lt;-- 0;</span></li>
        <li><span class="yacasExpression">ArcSin(Sin(_x)) &lt;-- x;</span></li>
      </ul>
      The last rule has no explicit precedence specified in it (the precedence zero will be assigned automatically by the system).
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Yacas</i> will first try to match the pattern as a template. Names preceded or followed by an underscore can match any 
      one object: a number, a function, a list, etc. <i>Yacas</i> will assign the relevant variables as local
      variables within the rule, and try the predicates as stated in the pattern. The post-predicate (defined after the pattern) 
      is tried after all these matched. As an example, the simplification rule <span class="yacasExpression">_x - _x &lt;--0</span> specifies that the two objects at left 
      and at right of the minus sign should be the same for this transformation rule to apply.
    </p>
    <h2>Local simplification rules</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes you have an expression, and you want to use specific simplification rules on it that should not be universally applied. 
      This can be done with the <span class="yacasExpression">/:</span> and the <span class="yacasExpression">/::</span> operators. 
      Suppose we have the expression containing things such as <span class="yacasExpression">Ln(a*b)</span>, 
      and we want to change these into <span class="yacasExpression">Ln(a)+Ln(b)</span>. The easiest way to do this is using the <span class="yacasExpression">/:</span> operator as follows:
      <ul>
        <li><a class="commandlink">Sin(x)*Ln(a*b)</a> (example expression without simplification)</li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">Sin(x)*Ln(a*b) /: { Ln(_x*_y) &lt;- Ln(x)+Ln(y) }</a> (with instruction to simplify the expression)</li>
      </ul>
      A whole list of simplification rules can be built up in the list, and they will be applied to the expression on the left hand side
      of <span class="yacasExpression">/:</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that for these local rules, <span class="yacasExpression">&lt;-</span> should be used instead of <span class="yacasExpression">&lt;--</span>. 
      Using latter would result in a global definition of a new transformation rule on evaluation, which is not the intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="yacasExpression">/:</span> operator traverses an expression from the top down, trying to apply the rules from the beginning of the list of
      rules to the end of the list of rules. If no rules can be applied to the whole expression, it will try the sub-expressions of the
      expression being analyzed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might be sometimes necessary to use the <span class="yacasExpression">/::</span> operator, which repeatedly applies the <span class="yacasExpression">/:</span> operator until the result does not change
      any more. Caution is required, since rules can contradict each other, and that could result in an infinite loop. To detect this situation,
      just use <span class="yacasExpression">/:</span> repeatedly on the expression. The repetitive nature should become apparent.
    </p>
    <h2>Programming essentials</h2>
    <p>
      An important feature of <i>Yacas</i> is its programming language which allows you to create your own programs for doing calculations.
      This section describes some constructs and functions for control flow. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Looping can be done with the function <span class="yacasExpression">ForEach</span>. There are more options, but ForEach is the simplest to use for now and will suffice for this turorial.
      The statement form <span class="yacasExpression">ForEach(x, list) body</span>
      executes its body for each element of the list and assigns the variable x to that element each time. The 
      statement form <span class="yacasExpression">While(predicate) body</span>
      repeats execution of the expression represented by  <span class="yacasExpression">body</span> 
      until evaluation of the expression represented by <span class="yacasExpression">predicate</span> 
      returns <span class="yacasExpression">False</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This example loops over the integers from one to three, and writes out a line for each, multiplying the integer by 3 and displaying the result with the
      function <span class="yacasExpression">Echo</span>:
      <a class="commandlink">ForEach(x,1 .. 5) Echo(x," times 3 equals ",3*x);</a>
    </p>

	<h3>Compound statements</h3>
    <p>
      Multiple statements can be grouped together using the <span class="yacasExpression">[</span> and <span class="yacasExpression">]</span> brackets. The compound 
      <a class="commandlink">[a; Echo("In the middle"); 1+2;];</a> evaluates a, then the echo command, and finally 
      evaluates <span class="yacasExpression">1+2</span>, and returns the result
      of evaluating the last statement <span class="yacasExpression">1+2</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A variable can be declared local to a compound statement block by the function <span class="yacasExpression">Local(var1, var2,...)</span>. For example, if you execute
      <a class="commandlink">[Local(v);v:=1+2;v;];</a> the result will be 3. The program body created a variable called <span class="yacasExpression">v</span>, assigned the
      value of evaluating <span class="yacasExpression">1+2</span> to it, and made sure the contents of the variable <span class="yacasExpression">v</span> were returned. 
      If you now evaluate <a class="commandlink">v</a>
      afterwards you will notice that the variable <span class="yacasExpression">v</span> is not bound to a value any more. The variable <span class="yacasExpression">v</span> 
      was defined locally in the program body between the two square brackets <span class="yacasExpression">[</span> and <span class="yacasExpression">]</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conditional execution is implemented by the <span class="yacasExpression">If(predicate, body1, body2)</span> function call. If the expression
      <span class="yacasExpression">predicate</span> evaluates to <span class="yacasExpression">True</span>, the expression represented by <span class="yacasExpression">body1</span> 
      is evaluated, otherwise <span class="yacasExpression">body2</span> is evaluated, and the corresponding 
      value is returned. For example, the absolute value of a number can be computed with: 
      <a class="commandlink">f(x) := If(x < 0,-x,x);</a> (note that there already is a standard library function that calculates the absolute
      value of a number).
    </p>
    <p>
      Variables can also be made to be local to a small set of functions, with  <span class="yacasExpression">LocalSymbols(variables) body</span>. For example, the following code snippet:
      <a class="commandlink">LocalSymbols(a,b) [a:=0;b:=0; inc():=[a:=a+1;b:=b-1;]; show():=Echo("a = ",a," b = ",b); ];</a> defines two functions, <span class="yacasExpression">inc</span>
      and <span class="yacasExpression">show</span>. Calling <a class="commandlink">inc()</a> repeatedly increments <span class="yacasExpression">a</span> and decrements
      <span class="yacasExpression">b</span>, and calling <a class="commandlink">show()</a> then shows the result. The variables are local to these two functions, as you can see
      by evaluating <a class="commandlink">a</a> and <a class="commandlink">b</a> outside the scope of these two functions. This feature is very important when writing a larger body
      of code, where you want to be able to guarantee that there are no unintended side-effects due to two bits of code defined in different files accidentally using the same global
      variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      To illustrate these features, let us create a list of all even integers from 2 to 20 and compute the product of all those integers except 
      those divisible by 3. (What follows is not necessarily the most economical way to do it in <i>Yacas</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <pre>
        <a class="commandlink">
[
  Local(L,i,answer);
  L:={};
  i:=2;
  /* Make a list of all even integers from 2 to 20 */
  While (i&lt;=20)
  [
    L := Append(L,i);
    i := i + 2;
  ];
  /* Now calculate the product of all of 
     these numbers that are not divisible by 3 */
  answer := 1;
  ForEach(i,L)
    If (Mod(i, 3)!=0, answer := answer * i);
  /* And return the answer */
  answer;
];</a>
      </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      We used a shorter form of <span class="yacasExpression">If(predicate, body)</span> with only one body which is executed when the condition holds. If the condition does not 
      hold, this function call returns <span class="yacasExpression">False</span>. We also introduced comments, which can be placed between 
      <span class="yacasExpression">/*</span> and <span class="yacasExpression">*/</span>. <i>Yacas</i> will ignore anything
      between those two. When putting a program in a file you can also use <span class="yacasExpression">//</span>. Everything after 
      <span class="yacasExpression">//</span> up until the end of the line will be a comment.
      Also shown is the use of the <span class="yacasExpression">While</span> function. Its form is <span class="yacasExpression">While (predicate) body</span>. 
      While the expression represented by <span class="yacasExpression">predicate</span> evaluates to <span class="yacasExpression">True</span>, 
      the expression represented by <span class="yacasExpression">body</span> will keep on being evaluated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The above example is not the shortest possible way to write out the algorithm. It is written out in a procedural way, where the program explains 
      step by step what the computer should do. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with the approach of writing down a program in a procedural way, 
      but the symbolic nature of <i>Yacas</i> also allows you to write it in a more concise, elegant, compact way, by combining function calls. 
    </p>
    <p>
      There is nothing wrong with procedural style, but there is amore 'functional' approach to the same problem would go as follows below. The advantage 
      of the functional approach is that it is shorter and more concise (the difference is cosmetic mostly). 
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we show how to do the same calculation in a functional style, we need to explain what a "pure function" is, as you will need it a lot
      when programming in a functional style. We will jump in with an example that should be self-explanatory. Consider the expression <span class="yacasExpression">Lambda({x,y},x+y)</span>.
      This has two arguments, the first listing x and y, and the second an expression. We can use this construct with the function Apply as follows:
      <a class="commandlink">Apply(Lambda({x,y},x+y),{2,3})</a>. The result should be 5, the result of adding 2 and 3. The expression starting with <span class="yacasExpression">Lambda</span>
      is essentially a prescription for a specific operation, where it is stated that it accepts 2 arguments, and returns the two arguments added together. 
      In this case, since the operation was so simple, we could also have used the name of a function to apply the arguments to, the addition operator
      in this case <a class="commandlink">Apply("+",{2,3})</a>. When the operations become more complex however, the Lambda construct becomes more useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we are ready to do the same example using a functional approach. First, let us construct a list with all even numbers from 2 to 20. For this we 
      use the <span class="yacasExpression">..</span> operator to set up all numbers from one to ten, and then 
      multiply that with two: <a class="commandlink">2*(1 .. 10)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we want an expression that returns all the even numbers up to 20 which are not divisible by 3. For this we can use <span class="yacasExpression">Select</span>, 
      which takes as first argument a predicate that should return <span class="yacasExpression">True</span> if the list item is to be accepted, and false otherwise, 
      and as second argument the list in question:
      <a class="commandlink">Select(Lambda({n},Mod(n,3)!=0),2*(1 .. 10))</a>.
      <br />
      The numbers 6, 12 and 18 have been correctly filtered out. Here you see one example of a pure function where the operation is a little bit more complex. 
    </p>
    <p>
      All that remains is to factor the items in this list. For this we can use <span class="yacasExpression">UnFlatten</span>.
      Two examples of the use of UnFlatten are <a class="commandlink">UnFlatten({a,b,c},"*",1)</a> and <a class="commandlink">UnFlatten({a,b,c},"+",0)</a>.
      The 0 and 1 are a base element to start with when grouping the arguments in to an expression (hence it is zero for addition and 1 for multiplication).
    </p>
    <p>	
       Now we have all the ingredients to finally do the same calculation we did above in a procedural way, but this time we can do it in a functional style,
       and thus captured in one concise single line: <a class="commandlink">UnFlatten(Select(Lambda({n},Mod(n,3)!=0),2*(1 .. 10)),"*",1)</a>. 
       As was mentioned before, the choice between the two is mostly a matter of style. 
    </p>

    <h2>Macros</h2>
    <p>
      One of the powerful constructs in <i>Yacas</i> is the construct of a macro. In its essence, a macro is a prescription to create another program before
      executing the program. An example perhaps explains it best. Evaluate the following expression 
      <a class="commandlink">Macro(for,{st,pr,in,bd}) [(@st);While(@pr)[(@bd);(@in);];];</a>. This expression defines a macro that allows for looping.
      <i>Yacas</i> has a <span class="yacasExpression">For</span> function already, but this is how it could be defined in one line (In <i>Yacas</i> the 
      <span class="yacasExpression">For</span> function is bodied, we left that
      out here for clarity, as the example is about macros). 
    </p>
    <p>
      To see it work just type <a class="commandlink">for(i:=0,i&lt;3,i:=i+1,Echo(i))</a>. You will see the count from one to three.
    </p>
    <p>
      The construct works as follows; The expression defining the macro sets up a macro named <span class="yacasExpression">for</span> with four arguments. On the right is the
      body of the macro. This body contains expressions of the form <span class="yacasExpression">@var</span>. These are replaced by the values passed in on calling the macro.
      After all the variables have been replaced, the resulting expression is evaluated. In effect a new program has been created. Such macro
      constructs come from LISP, and are famous for allowing you to almost design your own programming language constructs just for your own
      problem at hand. When used right, macros can greatly simplify the task of writing a program.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also use the back-quote <span class="yacasExpression">`</span> to expand a macro in-place. It takes on the form <span class="yacasExpression">`(expression)</span>, 
      where the expression can again contain 
      sub-expressions of the form <span class="yacasExpression">@variable</span>. These instances will be replaced with the values of these variables.
    </p>

    <h2>The practice of programming in <i>Yacas</i></h2>
    <p>
      When you become more proficient in working with <i>Yacas</i> you will be doing more and more sophisticated calculations. For such calculations it is generally
      necessary to write little programs. In real life you will usually write these programs in a text editor, and then start <i>Yacas</i>, load the text file
      you just wrote, and try out the calculation. Generally this is an iterative process, where you go back to the text editor to modify something, and then
      go back to <i>Yacas</i>, type <a class="commandlink">restart</a> and then reload the file. 
    </p>
    <p>
      On this site you can run <i>Yacas</i> in a little window called a Yacas calculation center (the same as the one below this tutorial). On page
      there is tab that contains a <i>Yacas</i> calculation center. If you click on that tab you will be directed to a larger calculation center than the
      one below this tutorial. In this page you can easily switch between doing a calculation and editing a program to load at startup. We tried to make the 
      experience match the general use of <i>Yacas</i> on a desktop as much as possible. The Yacas journal (which you see when you go to the <i>Yacas</i> web
      site) contains examples of calculations done before by others.

    <h2>Defining your own operators</h2>
    <p>
      Large part of the <i>Yacas</i> system is defined in the scripting language itself. This includes the definitions of the operators it accepts,
      and their precedences. This means that you too can define your own operators. This section shows you how to do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose we wanted to define a function <span class="yacasExpression">F(x,y)=x/y+y/x</span>. We could use the standard syntax <a class="commandlink">F(a,b) := a/b + b/a;</a>.
      <a class="commandlink">F(1,2);</a>. For the purpose of this demonstration, lets assume that we want to define an infix operator <span class="yacasExpression">xx</span> for this 
      operation. We can teach <i>Yacas</i> about this infix operator with <a class="commandlink">Infix("xx", OpPrecedence("/"));</a>. Here we told
      <i>Yacas</i> that the operator <span class="yacasExpression">xx</span> is to have the same precedence as the division operator.
      We can now proceed to tell <i>Yacas</i> how to evaluate expressions involving the operator <span class="yacasExpression">xx</span> by defining it as we would with a function, 
      <a class="commandlink">a xx b := a/b + b/a;</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      You can verify for yourself <a class="commandlink">3 xx 2 + 1;</a> and <a class="commandlink">1 + 3 xx 2;</a> return the same value, and that they
      follow the precedence rules (eg. <span class="yacasExpression">xx</span> binds stronger than <span class="yacasExpression">+</span>).
    </p>
    <p>
      We have chosen the name <span class="yacasExpression">xx</span> just to show that we don't need to use the special characters in the infix operator's name. However we must define this 
      operator as infix before using it in expressions, otherwise <i>Yacas</i> will raise a syntax error.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, we might decide to be completely flexible with this important function and also define it as a mathematical operator
      <span class="yacasExpression">##</span> . First we define <span class="yacasExpression">##</span> as a <i>bodied</i> function 
      and then proceed as before. First we can tell <i>Yacas</i> that <span class="yacasExpression">##</span> is a bodied
      operator with <a class="commandlink">Bodied("##", OpPrecedence("/"));</a>. Then we define the function itself:
      <a class="commandlink">##(a) b := a xx b;</a>. And now we can use the function, <a class="commandlink">##(1) 3 + 2;</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have used the name <span class="yacasExpression">##</span> but we could have used any other name such as 
      <span class="yacasExpression">xx</span> or <span class="yacasExpression">F</span> or even <span class="yacasExpression">_-+@+-_</span>.
      Apart from possibly confusing yourself, it doesn't matter what you call the functions you define.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is currently one limitation in <i>Yacas</i>: once a function name is declared as infix (prefix, postfix) or bodied, it will
      always be interpreted that way. If we declare a function <span class="yacasExpression">f</span> to be bodied, we may later define 
      different functions named <span class="yacasExpression">f</span> with different 
      numbers of arguments, however all of these functions must be bodied.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you use infix operators and either a prefix of postfix operator next to it you can run in to a situation where <i>Yacas</i>
      can not quite figure out what you typed. This happens when the operators are right next to each other and all consist of symbols
      (and could thus in principle form a single operator). <i>Yacas</i> will raise an error in that case. This can be avoided by 
      inserting spaces.
    </p>

    <h2>Some assorted programming topics</h2>
    <p>
      One use of lists is the associative list, sometimes called a dictionary in other programming languages, which is implemented in <i>Yacas</i> 
      simply as a list of key-value pairs. Keys must be strings and values may be any objects. Associative lists can also work as mini-databases,
      where a name is associated to an object. 
      As an example, first enter <a class="commandlink">record:={};</a> to set up an empty record. After that, we can fill arbitrary fields in this
      record:
      <ul>
        <li><a class="commandlink">record["name"]:="Isaia";</a></li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">record["occupation"]:="prophet";</a></li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">record["is alive"]:=False;</a></li>
      </ul>
      Now, evaluating <a class="commandlink">record["name"]</a> should result in the answer <span class="yacasExpression">"Isaia"</span>. The record is now a list that
      contains three sublists, as you can see by evaluating <a class="commandlink">record</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assignment of multiple variables is also possible using lists. For instance, evaluating <a class="commandlink">{x,y}:={2!,3!}</a> will result 
      in 2 being assigned to <a class="commandlink">x</a> and 6 to <a class="commandlink">y</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When assigning variables, the right hand side is evaluated before it is assigned. Thus
      <a class="commandlink">a:=2*2</a> will set a to 4. This is however <i>not</i> the case for 
      functions. When entering <a class="commandlink">f(x):=x+x</a> the right hand side, <span class="yacasExpression">x+x</span>, is
      not evaluated before being assigned. This can be forced by using <span class="yacasExpression">Eval()</span>. 
      Defining <span class="yacasExpression">f(x)</span> with <a class="commandlink">f(x):=Eval(x+x)</a>
      will tell the system to first evaluate <span class="yacasExpression">x+x</span> (which results in <span class="yacasExpression">2*x</span>) 
      before assigning it to the user function <span class="yacasExpression">f</span>. This specific example is not a
      very useful one but it will come in handy when the operation being performed on the right hand side is expensive. For example, if we
      evaluate a Taylor series expansion before assigning it to the user-defined function, the engine doesn't need to create the Taylor
      series expansion each time that user-defined function is called.
    </p>
    <p>
      The imaginary unit i is denoted <span class="yacasExpression">I</span> and complex numbers can be entered as either expressions 
      involving <span class="yacasExpression">I</span>, as for example 
      <a class="commandlink">1+I*2</a>, or explicitly as <a class="commandlink">Complex(a,b)</a> for a+ib. The form <span class="yacasExpression">Complex(re,im)</span>
      is the way <i>Yacas</i> deals with complex numbers internally.
    </p>

	<h3>Linear Algebra</h3>
    <p>
      Vectors of fixed dimension are represented as lists of their components. The list <a class="commandlink">{1, 2+x, 3*Sin(p)}</a> would be a 
      three-dimensional vector with components <span class="yacasExpression">1</span>, <span class="yacasExpression">2+x</span> and 
      <span class="yacasExpression">3*Sin(p)</span>. Matrices are represented as a lists of lists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vector components can be assigned values just like list items, since they are in fact list items. If we first set up a variable called "vector"
      to contain a three-dimensional vector with the command <a class="commandlink">vector:=ZeroVector(3);</a> (you can verify that it is indeed
      a vector with all components set to zero by evaluating <a class="commandlink">vector</a>), you can change elements of the vector just like you
      would the elements of a list (seeing as it is represented as a list). For example, to set the second element to two, just evaluate
      <a class="commandlink">vector[2] := 2;</a>. This results in a new value for <a class="commandlink">vector</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Yacas</i> can perform multiplication of matrices, vectors and numbers as usual in linear algebra. 
      The standard <i>Yacas</i> script library also includes taking the determinant and inverse of a matrix, finding 
      eigenvectors and eigenvalues (in simple cases) and solving linear sets of equations, such as A * x = b where A is a matrix, and x and b are vectors. 
      As a little example to wetten your appetite, we define a Hilbert matrix: <a class="commandlink">hilbert:=HilbertMatrix(3)</a>. We can then
      calculate the determinant with <a class="commandlink">Determinant(hilbert)</a>, or the inverse with <a class="commandlink">Inverse(hilbert)</a>.
      There are several more matrix operations supported. See the reference manual for more details.
    </p>

	<h3>"Threading" of functions</h3>
    <p>
      Some functions in <i>Yacas</i> can be "threaded". This means that calling the function
      with a list as argument will result in a list with that function being
      called on each item in the list. E.g. <a class="commandlink">Sin({a,b,c});</a>
      will result in <span class="yacasExpression">{Sin(a),Sin(b),Sin(c)}</span>. This functionality is implemented for most normal analytic functions and arithmetic operators.
    </p>

    <h3>Functions as lists</h3>
    <p>
      For some work it pays to understand how things work under the hood. Internally, <i>Yacas</i> represents all atomic expressions (numbers 
      and variables) as strings and all compound expressions as lists, like LISP. Try <a class="commandlink">FullForm(a+b*c);</a> and you will see
      the text <span class="yacasExpression">(+ a (* b c ))</span> appear on the screen. This function is occasionally useful, for example when trying to figure out why a specific 
      transformation rule does not work on a specific expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you try <a class="commandlink">FullForm(1+2)</a> you will see that the result is not quite what we intended. The system first adds up one
      and two, and then shows the tree structure of the end result, which is a simple number 3. To stop <i>Yacas</i> from evaluating something,
      you can use the function <span class="yacasExpression">Hold</span>, as <a class="commandlink">FullForm(Hold(1+2))</a>. The function 
      <span class="yacasExpression">Eval</span> is the opposite, it instructs <i>Yacas</i>
      to re-evaluate its argument (effectively evaluating it twice). This undoes the effect of Hold, as for example <a class="commandlink">Eval(Hold(1+2))</a>.
    </p>
    <p>      
      Also, any expression can be converted to a list by the function Listify or back to an expression by the function UnList:
      <ul>
        <li><a class="commandlink">Listify(a+b*(c+d));</a></li>
        <li><a class="commandlink">UnList({Atom("+"),x,1});</a></li>
      </ul>
      Note that the first element of the list is the name of the function <span class="yacasExpression">+</span which is equivalently 
      represented as <a class="commandlink">Atom("+")</a> and that 
      the subexpression <span class="yacasExpression">b*(c+d)</span> was not converted to list form. Listify just took the top node of the expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      This concludes the online tutorial. A good place to go next is the "Yacas Journal", which has some examples small but useful programs written in 
      <i>Yacas</i> to do specific calculations.
