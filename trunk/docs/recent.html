        <a target="LibraryFrame" href="journaldescr.html?newtonsqrt" >Fun with derivatives part 4: Newton iteration to determine the inverse square root</a> - 
          A while back I came across the trick used in Quake to efficiently approximate the inverse square root (which is 
          probably needed in a 3D engine to normalize vectors). It is also a nice demonstration on how one could go about 
          approximating a function by using Newton iteration. That is the subject of this article.

        <a target="LibraryFrame" href="journaldescr.html?newtonconvergence" >Fun with derivatives part 3: fast convergence of Newton iteration</a> - 
          Newton iteration is a natural fit for computer algebra systems because you can use the symbolic facilities first
          to take the derivative of a function, and then later on use the arbitrary-precision numeric support to get a very
          accurate numeric approximation (starting from a sufficiently close guess). Newton iteration can converge very fast,
          which you can see in action in this article.

          This short article shows how you one would go about writing one line of code  that generates a Taylor series
          expansion of a function in <i>Yacas</i> (without using the built-in function).

        <a target="LibraryFrame" href="journaldescr.html?derivative" >Fun with derivatives part 1: defining the concept of a derivative in <i>Yacas</i></a> - 
          Taking a derivative is one of the mathematical operations that is easily explained to a computer. This article shows how 
          it can be done with a few lines of code in <i>Yacas</i>. You can also directly try it out, or extend the code to handle 
          more complex cases.
