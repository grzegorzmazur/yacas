        <tr> 
          <td bgcolor=ffffff>
		Pari-GP is somewhat similar to Yacas, but based on pure "C" code and it
		is geared to Number Theory while not being actually "symbolic". That is,
		all expressions are expanded completely. (1+x)^2 = 1+2*x+x^2 and is not
		stored in the unexpanded form. Also, no LISP or equivalent is included.
		More details are available on the web.

              (like computation- intense numeric applications, graphical interfaces, 
              etc.) under one roof. It is distributed under the terms and conditions

          <td bgcolor=ffffff> 
            From the writers of the well-known "Structure and interpretation of computer programs", this
            book (available for free online) delves into doing classical mechanics calculations using
            Scheme in this case (Scheme is a Lisp dialect, and as such related to Yacas). This is not 
            strictly a book about computer algebra, but about one of the uses for computer algebra. 
            This should be nice literature for Physics students wanting to try out calculations in this field.
            No need to roll your own Lisp dialect, just follow this book!
