      This is a wonderful book on the Gosper-Zeilberger algorithm. Definitely worth a read, and a nice
      explanation of one of the success stories in the field of computer algebra.

      <a target="newwin" href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/SICM/">Structure and interpretation of classical mechanics</a> -
      From the writers of the well-known "Structure and interpretation of computer programs", this
      book (available for free online) delves into doing classical mechanics calculations using
      Scheme in this case (Scheme is a Lisp dialect, and as such related to Yacas). This is not 
      strictly a book about computer algebra, but about one of the uses for computer algebra. 
      This should be nice literature for Physics students wanting to try out calculations in this field.
      No need to roll your own Lisp dialect, just follow this book!

    <h2>Other freely available math packages that have symbolic capabilities</h2>
    <p>
      This is a short list of links to other related math packages I could find on the net for 
      which source code is also available. If you know of any other software please 
      let me know.

    <p>
      <a target="newwin" href="http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/">Pari-GP</a> - 
      Pari-GP is somewhat similar to Yacas, but based on pure "C" code and it
      is geared to Number Theory while not being actually "symbolic". That is,
      all expressions are expanded completely. (1+x)^2 = 1+2*x+x^2 and is not
      stored in the unexpanded form. Also, no LISP or equivalent is included.
      More details are available on the web.

      <a target="newwin" href="http://www.ginac.de/">Ginac</a> -
      Ginac is a c++ library for doing computer algebra. 
      It allows symbolic manipulation from within a c++ program. It is currently 
      in active development, and looks very promising. 
      <br /> 
      GiNaC is an iterated and recursive acronym for GiNaC is Not a 
      CAS, where CAS stands for Computer Algebra System. It is designed 
      to allow the creation of integrated systems that embed symbolic 
      manipulations together with more established areas of computer science 
      (like computation- intense numeric applications, graphical interfaces, 
      etc.) under one roof. It is distributed under the terms and conditions 
      of the GNU general public license (GPL).
