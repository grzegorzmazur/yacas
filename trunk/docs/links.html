<h2>Other freely available math packages that have symbolic capabilities</h2>
This is a short 
list of links to other related math packages I could find on the net for 
which source code is also available. If you know of any other software please 
let me know.

        <tr> 
          <td bgcolor=ffffff>
		Pari-GP is somewhat similar to Yacas, but based on pure "C" code and it
		is geared to Number Theory while not being actually "symbolic". That is,
		all expressions are expanded completely. (1+x)^2 = 1+2*x+x^2 and is not
		stored in the unexpanded form. Also, no LISP or equivalent is included.
		More details are available on the web.

        Yacas uses a memory manager optimized for allocating many small blocks of memory (like 
          an interpreter typically does), which was borrowed from Python.

	  This is a wonderful book on the Gosper-Zeilberger algorithm. Definitely worth a read, and a nice

        <tr> 
          <td bgcolor=ffffff> 
            From the writers of the well-known "Structure and interpretation of computer programs", this
            book (available for free online) delves into doing classical mechanics calculations using
            Scheme in this case (Scheme is a Lisp dialect, and as such related to Yacas). This is not 
            strictly a book about computer algebra, but about one of the uses for computer algebra. 
            This should be nice literature for Physics students wanting to try out calculations in this field.
            No need to roll your own Lisp dialect, just follow this book!
