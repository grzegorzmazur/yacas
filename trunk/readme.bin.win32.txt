

YACAS, INTRODUCTION
===================

This is the Windows binary release of Yacas. Yacas is a computer algebra
system. 


INSTALLING YACAS
================

You should find the following files in this distribution: 

    	yacas.exe   - the executable which you need to run to start yacas
    	scripts.dat - file containing some extra data needed by the executable
    	readme.txt  - this file
      copying.txt - copyright notice

In addition, the documentation to Yacas can be downloaded from the Yacas
web site, in html, pdf and postscript format.


RUNNING YACAS
=============

To run Yacas, you need to extract the files mentioned above from the zip
file into some directory. Yacas needs to run from the directory the files
were extracted in, or, alternatively, pass on extra parameters on the command
line to tell yacas where to find the 'scripts.dat' file. For example, if Yacas
was extracted into c:\myprogs\yacas\, then it can be invoked with :

    	c:\myprogs\yacas\yacas.exe --archive c:\myprogs\yacas\scripts.dat
