- Get MathSin MathPi etcetera working.
- command line support for test scripts (-pc flags at least)
- run test scripts

- LispArcCos
- LispArcTan
- LispPi
- LispFastMod

- LispDllEnumerate
- LispDllDirectory
- LispDllLoad
- LispDllUnload

- LispPatchLoad
- LispPatchString

- Use the hints in the console version also!
- LispFastIsPrime

- Some more functions that are defined in yacasmain.cpp, 
	Exit
	IsExitRequested
	HistorySize
	StaSiz
	IsPromptShown
	ReadCmdLineString
	FileSize

- command line flags for console version, useful for doing the test scripts

- Supporting the default read-eval-print loop from script?

- Run the tests from Java
- Give some performance statistics on comparison between Java and C++
- button in applet that allows stopping current calculation

- LispTraceStack





- port over the user-defined function classes

- FastMod
- pre-port all functions (in one large file, so I can easily do a
  global query-replace everywhere, before copy-pasting the code
  to Java)
- port functions one by one
- Remove LispPtr in favor of LispObject (needs lots of changes,
  getters and setters).
- Change name of HashTable to StringTable
- two methods were doubly defined in corefunctions.h (NewLocals and another one nearby)
- Double-check that LocalFrame is handled correctly everywhere, eg the destructor is not called, so need to call its Delete method directly
- CommonLispTokenizer.java
