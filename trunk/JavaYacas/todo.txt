- test program for the cyacas.h api
- test: ToBase to also work with real numbers
- update changes.html
- check that all files are checked in
- fix for plugins_available.h not being available at the beginning
- fix for the sockets in yacasmain.cpp

- run test scripts, and fix problems accordingly
- LispFastMod
- LispDllEnumerate
- LispDllDirectory
- LispDllLoad
- LispDllUnload

- LispPatchLoad
- LispPatchString


- Some more functions that are defined in yacasmain.cpp, 
	Exit
	IsExitRequested
	HistorySize
	StaSiz
	IsPromptShown
	ReadCmdLineString
	FileSize

- command line flags for console version, useful for doing the test scripts

- Supporting the default read-eval-print loop from script?

- Run the tests from Java
- Give some performance statistics on comparison between Java and C++
- button in applet that allows stopping current calculation


- LispDefaultTokenizer
- LispCommonLispTokenizer
- LispCTokenizer
- LispXmlTokenizer
- LispExplodeTag




- LispCustomEval
- LispCustomEvalExpression
- LispCustomEvalResult
- LispCustomEvalLocals
- LispCustomEvalStop
- LispTraceRule
- LispTraceStack





- port over the user-defined function classes

- FastMod
- pre-port all functions (in one large file, so I can easily do a
  global query-replace everywhere, before copy-pasting the code
  to Java)
- port functions one by one
- Remove LispPtr in favor of LispObject (needs lots of changes,
  getters and setters).
- Change name of HashTable to StringTable
- two methods were doubly defined in corefunctions.h (NewLocals and another one nearby)
- Double-check that LocalFrame is handled correctly everywhere, eg the destructor is not called, so need to call its Delete method directly
- CommonLispTokenizer.java


TO DO Java UI, before I can use it comfortably too:
- let the applet get focus immediately
- screen is not white on Windows
- try to find a proportional font that runs everywhere 
- truncating strings (making them continue on the next line
- hints for the console applet too 
- Allow editing one file for loading
- stop current execution
- applet should be a notebook with embedded objects (graphs?)
- nicely rendered formulae
- nice link to help files.
- easy getting started for beginners.
