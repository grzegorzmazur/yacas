- LispPi
- LispFastIsPrime

- Some more functions that are defined in yacasmain.cpp, 
	OSVersion
	Exit
	IsExitRequested
	HistorySize
	StaSiz
	IsPromptShown
	ReadCmdLineString
	FileSize

- command line flags for console version, useful for doing the test scripts

- Supporting the default read-eval-print loop from script?

- Run the tests from Java
- Give some performance statistics on comparison between Java and C++
- button in applet that allows stopping current calculation
- LispPatchLoad
- LispPatchString

- LispDllLoad
- LispDllUnload
- LispDllEnumerate

- LispDefaultTokenizer
- LispCommonLispTokenizer
- LispCTokenizer
- LispXmlTokenizer

- LispCustomEval
- LispCustomEvalExpression
- LispCustomEvalResult
- LispCustomEvalLocals
- LispCustomEvalStop
- LispTraceRule
- LispTraceStack


- LispDumpBigNumberDebugInfo

- LispDllDirectory



- port over the user-defined function classes

- FastMod
- pre-port all functions (in one large file, so I can easily do a
  global query-replace everywhere, before copy-pasting the code
  to Java)
- port functions one by one
- Remove LispPtr in favor of LispObject (needs lots of changes,
  getters and setters).
- Change name of HashTable to StringTable
- console applet and tegic applet
- two methods were doubly defined in corefunctions.h (NewLocals and another one nearby)
- Double-check that LocalFrame is handled correctly everywhere, eg the destructor is not called, so need to call its Delete method directly
- find a way for Java version to report correct version
- CommonLispTokenizer.java
- LispSecure
