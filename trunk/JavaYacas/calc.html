<H1>Yacas Phone Edition Tutorial</H1>
This applet demonstrates the user interface for Yacas on a phone. 
<P>
To enter a command, press the sequence of keys with the intended letters on it. You can stop before the entire
command has been entered, as a menu will pop up with a possible command you intended to invoke.
<P>
The last entered key can be cleared with the "C" key. 
<P>
To try to match the number just entered to a command, press the "*+" key. A list of matches of a specific command will
pop up. If you intended a different command, press this key again. Otherwise, you can step through the
commands with the up and down arrows, and then select a command by pressing the center button at the 
center of the arrows. 
<P>
To enter a symbolic character, press the "1" key. A button bar will pop up. Use the arrows and then the center
key to select the key, or press "1" again to make the button bar disappear.
<P>
After the expression has been entered, press "#" to evaluate the expression. This demo does not really do 
calculations, but it allows you to try out the user interface (prototype).
