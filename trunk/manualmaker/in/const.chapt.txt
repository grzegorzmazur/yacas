*CMD % --- Previous result

*CORE

*CALL

%

*PARMS

*DESC

% evaluates to the previous result on the command line. % is a global
variable that is bound to the previous result from the command line.
Using % will evaluate the previous result (This uses the functionality
offered by the LazyGlobal command).

Typical examples are {Simplify(%)} and {PrettyForm(%)}to simplify and show the result in a nice
form respectively.

*E.G.

	In> Taylor(x,0,5)Sin(x)
	Out> x-x^3/6+x^5/120;
	In> PrettyForm(%)
	
	     3    5
	    x    x
	x - -- + ---
	    6    120

*A True

*A False

*CMD True, False --- Boolean constants

*CORE

*CALL

True

False

*DESC

{True} and {False} are typically the result
of boolean expressions like {2 &lt 3} and {True And False}.

*SEE And, Or, Not

*CMD EndOfFile --- End-of-file marker

*CORE

*CALL

EndOfFile

*DESC

End of file marker when reading from file. If a file
contains the expression {EndOfFile;} the
operation will stop reading the file at that point.

*CMD Infinity --- Constant representing mathematical infinity

*STD

*CALL

Infinity

*DESC

Infinity represents infinity. It can be the result of certain
calculations.

Note that for most analytic functions Yacas understands Infinity.
Thus {Infinity*2} will return Infinity, and {a &lt Infinity} will evaluate to True.

*E.G.

	In> 2*Infinity
	Out> Infinity;
	In> 2<Infinity
	Out> True;

*CMD Pi --- Mathematical constant, 3.14159...

*STD

*CALL

Pi

*DESC

Pi represents the value of pi. When the N(..) function is used,
Pi is set to the correct value. It is probably better to use
Pi than Pi(), for simplification purposes.

*E.G.

	In> Sin(3*Pi/2)
	Out> -1;
	In> Pi
	Out> Pi;
	In> N(Pi)
	Out> 3.1415926535;

*SEE Sin, Cos

*CMD Undefined --- Constant signifying an undefined result

*STD

*CALL

Undefined

*DESC

Undefined is a token that can be returned by a function when it considers
its input to be invalid. The resulting output is then undefined.

*E.G.

	In> 2*Infinity
	Out> Infinity;
	In> 0*Infinity
	Out> Undefined;

*SEE Infinity
