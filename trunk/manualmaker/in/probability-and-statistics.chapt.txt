		Probability

*INTRO
Each distribution is represented as an entity. For each distribution
known to the system the check of parameters consistiency is done. If
the parameters for a distribution are not allowed, Undefined object is
returned. For example, {NormalDistribution}(a, -1) evaluates to
Undefined, because of negative variance.

*CMD BernoulliDistribution --- represents a Bernoulli distribution
*STD
*CALL 
	{BernoulliDistribution}(p)

*PARMS
{p} -- a probability of an event in a single trial.

*DESC 
A random variable has {BernoulliDistribution} with probability {p} if
it can be interpreted as an indicator of an event, where {p} is the
probability to observe the event in a single trial.

Numerical value of {p} must sutisfy inequations 0<p<1.

*SEE BinomialDistribution

*CMD BinomialDistribution --- represents a binomial distribution
*STD
*CALL
	{BinomailDistribution}(p,n)

*PARMS
{p} -- a probability to observe an event in single trial

{n} -- a number of trials

*DESC
Suppose we repeat a trial {n} times. The probability to observe an
event in a single trial is {p} and outcomes in all trials are mutually
independent. Then the number of trials where the event occured has
{BinomialDistribution}(p,n) distribution.

Numerical value of {p} must satisfy inequations 0<p<1. Numerical value
of {n} must be a positive integer. 

*SEE BernoulliDistribution

*CMD tDistribution --- Student's t distribution
*STD
*CALL
	{tDistribution}(m)

*PARMS 
{m} -- degrees of freedom

*DESC
Let {Y} and {Z} be independent random variables, {Y} have the 
NormalDistribution(0,1), {Z} have ChiSquareDistribution(m). Then 
Y/Sqrt(Z/m) has tDistribution(m).

Numerical value of {m} must be positive integer.

*CMD PDF --- Probability density function
*STD
*CALL
	{PDF}(dist,x)

*PARMS
{dist} -- a distribution type
{x} -- a value of random variable

*DESC
If {dist} is a discrete distribution, then {PDF} returns the
probability for a random variable with distribution {dist} to take a
value of {x}. If {dist} is a continuous distribution, then {PDF}
returns the density function at point x.

*CMD ChiSquareTest --- Pearson's ChiSquare test
*STD

*CALL
	{ChiSquareTest}( observed'freqs, expected'freqs)
	
	{ChiSquareTest}( observed'freqs, expected'freqs, estimated'params)

*PARMS
{observed'freqs} -- list of observed frequencies

{expected'freqs} -- list of expected frequencies

{estimated'params} -- number of estimated parameters

*DESC
ChiSquare test is intended to find out if our sample was drawn from a
given distribution or not. To find this out, one has to calculate
observed frequencies into certain intervals ans expected ones. To
calculate expected frequency the formula $n[i]:=n*p[i]$ must be used,
where $p[i]$ is the probability measure of $i$th interval, and $n$ is
the total number of observation. If any of the parameters of the
distribution were estimated, this number is givet as
{estimated'params}.

The function returns a list of three local substitution rules. First
of them containcs the test statistic, the second contains p'value and
the last one contains the degrees of freedom. 

The test statistic is distributed as ChiSquareDistribution(dof).
