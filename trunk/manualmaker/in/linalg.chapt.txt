*INTRO This chapter describes the commands for doing linear
algebra. They can be used to manipulate vectors, represented as lists,
and matrices, represented as lists of lists.

*CMD LeviCivita --- totally anti-symmetric Levi-Civita symbol
*STD
*CALL
	LeviCivita(list)

*PARMS

list - a list of integers 1 .. n in some order

*DESC

{LeviCivita} implements the Levi-Civita symbol. This is generally
useful for tensor calculus.  {list}  should be a list of integers,
and this function returns 1 if the integers are in successive order,
eg. {LeviCivita( {1,2,3,...} )}  would return 1. Swapping two elements of this
list would return -1. So, {LeviCivita( {2,1,3} )} would evaluate
to -1.

*E.G.

	In> LeviCivita({1,2,3})
	Out> 1;
	In> LeviCivita({2,1,3})
	Out> -1;
	In> LeviCivita({2,2,3})
	Out> 0;
