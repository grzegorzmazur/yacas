"% evaluates to the previous result on the command line. % is a global
variable that is bound to the previous result from the command line.
Using % will evaluate the previous result (This uses the functionality
offered by the LazyGlobal command). <p>

Typical examples are ":HtmlTerm("Simplify(%)"):" and ":
HtmlTerm("PrettyForm(%)"): "to simplify and show the result in a nice
form respectively.
";

AddAnchor("True");

SubSection()"True and False";  Text()"

":HtmlTerm("True"):" and ":HtmlTerm("False"):" are typically the result
of boolean expressions like ":HtmlTerm("2 &lt 3"):" and ":
HtmlTerm("True And False"):".";


AddAnchor("EndOfFile");
SubSection()"EndOfFile";  Text()"
EndOfFile : End of file marker when reading from file. If a file
contains the expression ":HtmlTerm("EndOfFile;"):" the
operation will stop reading the file at that point.

AddAnchor("Infinity");
SubSection()"Infinity";  Text()"

Infinity represents infinity. It can be the result of certain
calculations." :
HtmlNewParagraph() :
"
Note that for most analytic functions Yacas understands Infinity.
Thus ":HtmlTerm("Infinity*2"):" will return Infinity, and ":
HtmlTerm("a &lt Infinity"):" will evaluate to True.
";

AddAnchor("Pi");
SubSection()"Pi";  Text()"

Pi represents the value of pi. When the N(..) function is used,
Pi is set to the correct value. It is probably better to use
Pi than Pi(), for simplification purposes.
