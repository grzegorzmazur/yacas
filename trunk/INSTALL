This distribution has only been tested on a Linux box (RedHat 5.1)

To install, do the following:

* download yacas-<latest>.tgz

* type 'tar zxvf yacas-latest.tgz'

* go into the directory created (yacas-<version>).

* type './configure'

* type 'make'.

* You can now, if you like, type 'make test', to run the test script.

* type 'make install'. 

*  type 'yacas'  and you should see a Yacas prompt!
   You could now type 'Load("scripts/examples/tests");' to perform some
   standard tests. The scripts
   (which are installed in '/usr/local/share/yacas/') should also be
   a good starting point to see some example source code.
   You can always type '??', which should launch the help.


************************************************************

Whenever you modify the configure.in, or a Makefile.am, the new configure
or Makefile.in will get generated the next time you run make. Or, you can
do it manually:

        To regenerate the configure script: 'autoconf'
        To regenerate Makefile.in's: 'automake --gnu --include-deps'

Note that *every* file in the tarball (produced by 'make dist') is there
because it is listed in a Makefile.am somewhere. (The only exceptions are
some of the files in the root directory, which are implicitly required).


* As a bonus, I rolled a .spec file for Yacas. You can make RPM's! To
build source and binary RPM's, you can do:

	rpm -ta yacas-1.0.12.tar.gz

-tb builds binary RPM's only. You can also copy the .spec file into
/usr/src/redhat/SPECS, the tarball into /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES, go into
the SPECS directory, and do:

	rpm -ba yacas.spec

to build RPMS/SRPMS, and -bb to build RPMS only.

* Some targets you should know about:

	dist: Pulls everything together into a tarball.

	distcheck: Performs a build in another directory to make sure
		the makefiles know about all necessary files. You should
		always run this before uploading a new release.

	distclean: Removes files generated by the configure script. Use
		this if you want to reset configuration stuff; e.g. if you
		want the configure script to run without cached values.

	install-strip: Like install, but strips binaries. Very nice.
