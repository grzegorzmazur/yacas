  <h2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What is a computer algebra system?</font></h2>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
A computer algebra system, of which Yacas is one, is a program that
can manipulate mathematical expressions, potentially reducing the
time it takes to do a cumbersome but trivial calculation. It does
this symbolically, so a CAS can return a mathematical expression as
a resulting answer.

      <h2><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Status</font></h2>
      <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The language is very much 
      in a finished state. Any code written for it should be usable in future 
      versions. Also, the language should prove very easy to learn. </font> 
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Yacas is 
        written in very clean c++ code, and is very portable . It can compile 
        stand-alone, and is easily embeddable. Yacas contains a native arbitrary 
        precision arithmetic module, but can also be used with GMP. </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Things implemented 
        include: arbitrary precision, rational numeric, vector, complex, and matrix 
        computations (including inverses and determinants and solving matrix equations), 
        derivatives, solving, Taylor series, numerical solving (Newtons method), 
        and a lot more non-mathematical algorithms. The language natively supports 
        variables and user-defined functions. There is basic support for univariate
        polynomials, integrating functions and tensor calculations.

		Pari-GP is somewhat similar to Yacas, but based on pure "C" code and it
		is geared to Number Theory while not being actually "symbolic". That is,
		all expressions are expanded completely. (1+x)^2 = 1+2*x+x^2 and is not
		stored in the unexpanded form. Also, no LISP or equivalent is included.
		More details are available on the web.

      <ul>
        <li> This project was started by Ayal Pinkus</a>. 
        <li> John Lapeyre made some modifications to the make file, and improved some 
          math code. 
        <li> Juan Pablo reported many bugs, made many suggestions for improvements, and 
          supplied improved code (yacas scripts and makefile code).
        <li> Doreen 
          Pinkus designed this home page.  
        <li> Igor

          to the math library.  
        <li> Daniel 
          Richard G. added autoconf/automake scripts, made Sun/Sgi compilation 
          possible, created a rpm spec file, many many many changes to clean up 
          the source distribution.  
        <li> Ladislav 
          Zejda supplied patches to make Yacas work on Dec Alpha's.  
        <li> Fred 
          Bacon fixed some compiler errors on the newer gcc compiles. Reported 
          some important bugs.  
        <li> Schneelocke 
          reported an important bug in numeric calculations.  
        <li> Serge 
          Winitzki added factorials over rationals, TeXForm, did a major overhaul
          of the introduction manual (actually, he wrote large part of the manual
          as it is), and initiated numerous 
          improvements and test code for Yacas, and implemented yacas_client.
          Actually, Serge has been one of the larger contributors, and the
          main force behind the improved documentation.
        <li> Jay Belanger
          reported some bugs, and improved some of the GnuPlot code. He also wrote
          the yacas.el file, which allows you to run yacas from within emacs.
          His most recent version can be found <A href="ftp://vh213601.truman.edu/pub/Yacas/">here</a>  
        <li> Gopal Narayanan
             maintains the Debian package for Yacas.
        <li> Vladimir Livshits
             set up the initial sourceforge CVS repository, and updated the Windows version
             source code. He also greatly improved the logic theorem prover code.
        <li> Eugenia Loli
             Helped build the BeOS version of Yacas. It can be found

      	     Added some code for fast calculation of roots of a cubic polynomial.
        <li> Mark Arrasmith
		Helped greatly in setting up the fltk-based graphicaluser interface,
                and fixed some bugs relating to limits regarding infinity.
        <li> Robert V Schipper
		Ironed out a few bugs in Yacas.
        <li> Gopal Narayanan
		Debian package maintainer. Made a man page for Yacas.
        <li> Christian Obrecht
		Made a much better Limit, and made Yacas behave better at infinity.
        <li> Jitse Niesen
		Reported some bugs, helped improve various parts of Yacas, and
                greatly improved the manual for Yacas.
        <li> Pablo Di Napoli
                Fixed the configure script so Yacas compiles under cygwin.
        <li> Joris van der Hoeven
                Helped with texmacs support.
        <li> Alberto González Palomo
                Implemented a console-mode version of Yacas for AgendaVR. Changed the
                directory structure for the script files, and implemented initial
                support for OpenMath.
        <li> Jonathan Leto
		Helped improve the integration algorithm, and  helped extend
                the tests used for Yacas (finding numerous bugs).
        <li> Andrei Zorine
		Started the body of statistics code.
