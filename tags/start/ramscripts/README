This directory contains the ramscripts program. It reads in the
scripts in the scripts/ directory, and outputs the c++ source code
you need to include just after the CYacas environment object has
been constructed to stdout. It is currently experimental, but works.

call './ramscripts > some.inc', and then be sure to include it in
yacasmain.cc somewhere after construction. The scripts are now in the
executable!
