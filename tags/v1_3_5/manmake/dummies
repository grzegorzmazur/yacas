{parameter} -- parameter description

*DESC

Sometimes it does not work. For example, when using $Sin(x)^2+Cos(x)^2$ as its {parameter}.

*EG

	In> CommandName();
	Segmentation fault

*REM this is a comment -------------------------------------------

*REM describe several commands:

*CMD command1, command2, command3 --- manipulate entities as object-oriented services
*CORE
*CALL
	command1(arg1, ...)
	command2(arg1,arg2)
	command3()

*PARMS

{arg1}, {arg2} -- atoms, names of entities to manipulate

*DESC

Services are best manipulated as object-oriented entities relative to
the globally defined execution environment.

The function {command1} makes entities into services.

The function {command2} makes services into entities.

The function {command3} orients the objects.

*E.G.

	In> command1(1024)
	Out> 0;
We have successfully created a service.
	In> command2(0,0)
	Error: not enough memory
	Out> 0;
In this example, the environment was not object-oriented enough.
