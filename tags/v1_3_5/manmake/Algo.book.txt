This book is a detailed description of the algorithms used in the Yacas system for exact
symbolic and arbitrary-precision numerical computations. Very few of these
algorithms are new, and most are well-known.
The goal of this book is to become a compendium of all relevant issues
of design and implementation of these algorithms.

*INTRO This and subsequent chapters document the numerical algorithms used in
Yacas for exact integer calculations as well as for multiple precision
floating-point calculations. We give self-contained descriptions of
the non-trivial algorithms and estimate their computational cost.
Most of the algorithms were taken from referenced literature; the remaining algorithms were developed by us.
