        README for package "yacas" version 1.1.x

Yacas (Yet Another Computer Algebra System) is a small and highly
flexible general-purpose computer algebra language. The syntax uses a
infix-operator grammar parser. The distribution contains a small library
of mathematical functions, but its real strength is in the language in
which you can easily write your own symbolic manipulation algorithms.
The core engine supports arbitrary precision arithmetic and is able to execute
symbolic manipulations on various mathematical objects by following
user-defined rules.  

Read the file INSTALL for instructions on how to compile and install
Yacas. Yacas is portable across most Unix-ish platforms and requires a
standard C++ compiler such as "g++". Precompiled Red Hat (RPM) and
Debian (DEB) packages are also available.

For detailed information on Yacas features and usage, please see the
included documentation or go to the Yacas Web page, 
"http://yacas.sourceforge.net/".
