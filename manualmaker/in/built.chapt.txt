			Built-in functions

*AA MathNot

	    MathNot(expression)

MathNot(expression) :
Returns "False" if "expression" evaluates
to "True", and vice versa.

*AA MathAnd

	    MathAnd(...)

MathAnd(...) :
Lazy and: returns True" if all args evaluate to
"True", and does this by looking at first, and then at the
second argument, until one is "False".
If one is "False" it immediately returns "False" without
evaluating the rest. This is faster, but also means that none of the
arguments should cause side effects when they are evaluated.

*AA MathOr

	    MathOr(...)

MathOr(...) :
MathOr is the or equivalent of And. It is lazy-evaluated too.
"And(...)" and "Or(...)" do also exist. You can define
them as infix operators
yourself, so you have the choice of precedence. In the standard scripts
they are in fact declared as infix operators, so you can write
"expr1 And expr".

*AA BitAnd

*AA BitOr

*AA BitXor

	    BitAnd(n,m), BitOr(n,m), BitXor(n,m)

BitAnd(n,m), BitOr(n,m), BitXor(n,m) : return bitwise and, or and xor
of two numbers.

*AA Equals

	    Equals(a,b)

Equals(a,b) :
Compares evaluated a and b recursively
(stepping into expressions). so "Equals(a,b)" returns
"True" if the expressions would be printed exactly
the same, and "False" otherwise.

*AA LessThan

*AA GreaterThan

	    LessThan(a,b), GreaterThan(a,b)

LessThan(a,b), GreaterThan(a,b) :
Comparing numbers.

	    Math...

MathGcd(n,m)  (Greatest Common Divisor),
MathAdd(x,y),
MathSubtract(x,y),
MathMultiply(x,y),
MathDivide(x,y),
MathSqrt(x)  (Square root),
MathFloor(x), MathCeil(x),
MathAbs(x), MathMod(x,y),
MathExp(x), MathLog(x) (Natural logarithm),
MathPower(x,y),
MathSin(x), MathCos(x), MathTan(x),
MathArcSin(x), MathArcCos(x), MathArcTan(x),
MathDiv(x,y), MathMod(x,y) :
MathSqrt(x) (Square root),

Calculation of sin,cos,tan etc. of x. x HAS to
be a number. The reason Math is prepended to
the names is you might want to derive equivalent
non-evaluating functions. The Math... versions require the arguments
to be numbers.

	    Fast...

FastExp(x), FastLog(x) (Natural logarithm),
FastPower(x,y),
FastSin(x), FastCos(x), FastTan(x),
FastArcSin(x), FastArcCos(x), FastArcTan(x) :

Versions of these functions using the internal c version. These
should then at least be faster than the arbitrary precision versions.

*AA ShiftLeft

*AA ShiftRight

	    ShiftLeft(number,bits), ShiftRight(number,bits)

ShiftLeft(number,bits), ShiftRight(number,bits) :
Shift number bits to left or right.
