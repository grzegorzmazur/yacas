This distribution has only been tested on a Linux box (RedHat 5.1)

To install, do the following:

* download yacas-<latest>.tgz

* type 'tar zxvf yacas-latest.tgz'

* go into the directory created (yacas-<version>).

* type './configure'

* type 'make'.

* You can now, if you like, type 'make test', to run the test script.

* type 'make install'.

*  type 'yacas'  and you should see a Yacas prompt!
   You could now type 'Load("scripts/examples/tests.ys");' to perform some
   standard tests. The scripts
   (which are installed in '/usr/local/share/yacas/') should also be
   a good starting point to see some example source code.
   You can always type '??', which should launch the help.

To compile and install Proteus, the user interface for Yacas, please go
into the proteus/ directory and read the readme there.


************************************************************

Whenever you modify the configure.in, or a Makefile.am, the new configure
or Makefile.in will get generated the next time you run make. Or, you can
do it manually:

        To regenerate the configure script: 'autoconf'
        To regenerate Makefile.in's: 'automake --gnu --include-deps'

Note that *every* file in the tarball (produced by 'make dist') is there
because it is listed in a Makefile.am somewhere. (The only exceptions are
some of the files in the root directory, which are implicitly required).


* As a bonus, I rolled a .spec file for Yacas. You can make RPM's! To
build source and binary RPM's, you can do:

	rpm -ta yacas-1.0.12.tar.gz

-tb builds binary RPM's only. You can also copy the .spec file into
/usr/src/redhat/SPECS, the tarball into /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES, go into
the SPECS directory, and do:

	rpm -ba yacas.spec

to build RPMS/SRPMS, and -bb to build RPMS only.

* Some targets you should know about:

	dist: Pulls everything together into a tarball.

	distcheck: Performs a build in another directory to make sure
		the makefiles know about all necessary files. You should
		always run this before uploading a new release.

	distclean: Removes files generated by the configure script. Use
		this if you want to reset configuration stuff; e.g. if you
		want the configure script to run without cached values.

	install-strip: Like install, but strips binaries. Very nice.
