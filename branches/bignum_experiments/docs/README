paper2.tex - a much more extensive version of the paper (unpublished)

This paper describes the YACAS system in general and gives some salient examples. (I still can't believe it got published.)

winitzki01.* - source files for the paper:

S. Winitzki, "Uniform approximations for transcendental functions" (LNCS 2667 p. 780, Springer-Verlag, 2003)
This paper describes a novel uniform approximation for the Lambert's W function.

winitzki02.* - source files for the paper:

S. Winitzki, "Computing the incomplete Gamma function to arbitrary precision" (LNCS 2667 p. 790, Springer-Verlag, 2003)
This paper lists and compares various methods (but the case of negative real part of z is still not solved.) I give an analysis of convergence rate of the continued fraction.

winitzki03.tex - source file for the paper: 

S. Winitzki, "Arbitrary-precision computation of Chebyshev polynomials" (draft, not published)
This paper lists and compares various methods and finds the best one.
