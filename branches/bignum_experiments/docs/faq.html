    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
    <h3>What is a computer algebra system?</h3>
     
A computer algebra system (CAS) is a program that
can manipulate mathematical expressions, potentially reducing the
time it takes to perform cumbersome but trivial calculations. It does
this symbolically, so a CAS can return a mathematical expression as
a resulting answer.

    <h3>Why cannot Yacas solve my homework/integrodifferential matrix operator constraint equations/ [<i>insert another problem</i>]?</h3>

Yacas is developed by a small group of volunteers and does not yet perform many of the sophisticated tasks that a modern CAS can theoretically handle.
Ask the users' mailing list (see links below) if you have a specific problem that is covered in the manual and should be solvable by Yacas.
Yacas consists of a small kernel and a library of interpreted scripts in the easy-to-use Yacas language; the scripts contain all CAS-related functionality.
You are encouraged to contribute library code for solving a specific problem.

    <h3>I want to use Yacas from inside my own application. What should I do?</h3>
Yacas can be used in several ways:
<ul>
<li>as a command-line application that takes text from standard input and prints text to standard output;
<li>as a server listening on a port (also on remote hosts);
</ul>
These options allow you to use the functionality of an installed Yacas application directly from another application without having to link to any Yacas code.

    <h3>What platforms are supported?</h3>

Yacas can be run directly from the Yacas web site as a Java applet.

In addition, the C++ version of Yacas is very portable and runs on many platforms and OSes, including Unix flavors (including GNU/Linux and derivatives), Mac OS X, EPOC32, Ipaq and probably other devices running embedded Linux, and 32-bit Microsoft Windows (TM). 

    <h3>Yacas gives an error message, a wrong answer, etc. What's wrong?</h3>

Most probably it is a bug in Yacas, especially if you expected a correct answer after reading the manuals. Please let us know by posting to the developer's list (<a href="#maillist">see links below</a>).



    <h3>Is there a mailing list?</h2>
There is a <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/yacas-devel">mailing list for developers</A>, but you can also ask questions relating to Yacas there.
