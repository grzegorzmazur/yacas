Additional packages can be put in this directory. Call

yacas -d

to get the directory to install extra scripts in. 

If you have the package 'foo' just copy the file 'foo' and 'foo.def'
to the addons/ directory in the directory returned by 'yacas -d'.
foo.def will be automatically loaded. At startup you should
see 'Adding package [foo]'

If you have some package you released, please let me know, so I can make
a link to it from the main Yacas home page.
