   Also, some of the install routines aren't following the right convention...
   the way you tell automake what files go where on install goes something
   like this:

           scriptdir = $(datadir)/yacas

           script_DATA = file1 file2 file3 ...

   Automake does a transform on the "script_DATA" variable name to get
   "scriptdir" as the variable specifying the directory location.

   You're supposed to use the install-data-local target only when you want to
   do something really weird on installation, like putting in symlinks or a
   large bunch of files that can't be specified efficiently by normal means.

   If I could make a couple suggestions, it would be better to have a full
   download page (perhaps with older versions, release notes, etc.) than
   linking the tarball directly on the navigation bar. That would also make it
   feasible to set up a download link to e.g. yacas-1.0.40.tar.gz, rather than
   yacas-latest.tar.gz, which isn't as nice (makes it harder to determine the
   version if you find a file named like that in some random place on your HD,
   etc.)  Also, you really need a new nav bar graphic. The text is very
   low-contrast, difficult to read :(
