Yacas (Yet Another Computer Algebra System) is a small and highly flexible
general-purpose Computer Algebra System (CAS). The syntax uses an
infix-operator grammar parser. The distribution contains a small library
of mathematical functions, but its real strength is in the language in which
you can easily write your own symbolic manipulation algorithms. The core engine
supports arbitrary precision arithmetic and is able to execute symbolic
manipulations on various mathematical objects by following user-defined rules.  

Read the file INSTALL for instructions on how to compile and install
Yacas. Yacas is portable across most Unix-ish platforms (including MacOS X) 
as well as all modern MS Windows versions.

For detailed information on Yacas features and usage, please see the
included documentation or go to http://grzegorzmazur.github.io/yacas/

Yacas is distributed under the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v2.1 or, at
your discretion, any later version.
