Yacas (Yet Another Computer Algebra System) is a small and highly flexible
general-purpose Computer Algebra System (CAS). The syntax uses an
infix-operator grammar parser. The distribution contains a small library
of mathematical functions, but its real strength is in the language in which
you can easily write your own symbolic manipulation algorithms. The core engine
supports arbitrary precision arithmetic and is able to execute symbolic
manipulations on various mathematical objects by following user-defined rules.
For detailed information on yacas features and usage, see
`<http://www.yacas.org>`_.

=====
who is yacas for?
=====

This versatile Computer Algebra System (CAS) was developed to cater to a broad
audience, primarily consisting of mathematicians, engineers, and students. It 
provides a user-friendly platform for performing symbolic mathematical computations, 
solving intricate equations, all accessible via a command-line interface. 
Furthermore, it serves as a free alternative to commercial CAS software.

For mathematics enthusiasts (probably less than 1% of the population), 
this tool offers the capability to conduct advanced mathematical manipulations
and solve complex equations, making it valuable for research purposes and even 
recreational mathematical exploration.
On the other hand, students can benefit from its educational potential, 
using it as an open-source resource to learn and practice mathematics while 
experiencing the advantages of an open-source product like Yacas.
